        <title>A Time-Management Technique to Enhance Your Life &amp; Business</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dulCZpCxWE8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re all given the same 24 hours each day, but where you direct your time is something to think about. In response to some questions I’ve received, today I’m going to discuss &lt;strong&gt;time management and organization&lt;/strong&gt; a little further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where do you start? First things first—&lt;strong&gt;you’ll want to get out a pencil and paper and make a list of where your time is currently going&lt;/strong&gt;. Make note of your work hours, family commitments, and other activities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this is accomplished, assess the areas where your time is going to waste. This part of the exercise will allow you to pin down the essentials, determine where your time is needlessly going, and find out where you want it to go.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=When you’re able to highlight the activities that enrich your life, jot down when you’re going to devote time to those things or when you’ll be naturally engaged in them.%20localhost:4000/a-time-management-technique-to-enhance-your-life-business.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“When you’re able to highlight the activities that enrich your life, jot down when you’re going to devote time to those things or when you’ll be naturally engaged in them.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re able to highlight the activities that enrich your life, &lt;strong&gt;jot down when you’re going to devote time to those things or when you’ll be naturally engaged in them. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the total number of hours you spend immersed in those activities and add them to the number of hours you sleep each day. Then, &lt;strong&gt;subtract your grand total from 24, which will tell you how many hours you have left over to practice real estate sales. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you have four, six, or 12 hours remaining each week, let me know. &lt;strong&gt;This is where you can begin to make optimal use of those hours and find greater success in your real estate business. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So again, find out what that number is, and give me a call at 516-822-1442 so you can take the next step. For any other questions, feel free to reach out to me as well. I look forward to speaking with you! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 Tips That Will Have People Calling You Back in No Time</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/e3e2ETy8nf8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you keep calling someone but they won’t call you back, what can you do to get ahold of them? Here are three tips that will solve this problem.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;you can call, hang up if you get their voicemail, call again, hang up again if you get their voicemail, and then call one more time.&lt;/strong&gt; What’s the point of calling three times in a row? Speaking for myself, if my husband calls me three times in a row, there’s probably an urgent reason why and it means I should pick up the phone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Sooner or later, they’re bound to call you back.%20localhost:4000/3-tips-that-will-have-people-calling-you-back-in-no-time.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Sooner or later, they’re bound to call you back.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option is to use Slydial. With this program, you can connect directly to their voicemail and leave a message without calling them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If either of these tips fail, you can always just knock on their door. If they’re not home, try leaving a note. Sooner or later, they’re bound to call you back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to talk more about this topic or you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to call or email me. In the meantime, make it a great day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Avoid a Low Appraisal</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OEBHWddDHok?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you’re a buyer, a seller, or an agent, the last thing you want is to receive a low appraisal on a home you recently sold or wanted to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just had a buyer’s agent tell me that they simply “let the appraiser handle that.” That’s absolutely the wrong thing to do—in fact, there are three crucial things you must do to avoid a low appraisal in the first place:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure the appraiser has a detailed list&lt;/strong&gt; of all the features, amenities, and improvements of the home. Sellers, provide your Realtor with that list so they can give it to the appraiser.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find out if the appraiser would like comparable sales&lt;/strong&gt;. Even if they say no, provide them anyway. Do this before they go out to appraise the property, and make sure to use sensible comps—not ones that are too high, low, or far away. You want the appraiser to be able to utilize them in case they’re not familiar with your area.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide the appraiser with any supporting documentatio&lt;/strong&gt;n. A client’s home had an additional lot, and if we hadn’t provided the survey for it, the appraisal would not have been accurate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The last thing you want is to receive a low appraisal on a home.%20localhost:4000/how-to-avoid-a-low-appraisal.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The last thing you want is to receive a low appraisal on a home.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;​​​​​​&lt;br /&gt;If all else fails and you still receive a low appraisal, there are still other things you can do. We’ll be detailing these in a future video, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or would like further information. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Don't Let Cigarette Odors Cause Your Home Sale to Go up in Smoke</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/P_2cr6j9cZ8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you smoke cigarettes in your home, the odors this habit leaves behind could cause your home sale to go up in smoke. Thankfully, there are three cleaning tips that can help alleviate this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;Ask us a question&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/meeting/&quot;&gt;Set up a Skype or coffee meeting&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a cigarette smoker, you may have become smell-blind to the odors this habit can leave behind in your home. This can pose a big problem when it comes time to sell because non-smoking buyers are sure to notice this residual aroma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure cigarette odors don’t cause your home sale to go up in smoke, there are three key tips you should follow when you list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Have a full professional cleaning of your heating and cooling system.&lt;/strong&gt; Cigarette smoke will get trapped in your home’s HVAC unit itself, so simply changing out the air filter won’t be enough if you hope to rid your house of odors. Having a professional clean the ductwork, and the unit itself, will be your ticket to fresh-smelling air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Seal and repaint your walls and ceilings.&lt;/strong&gt; Your home’s walls and ceilings can trap unpleasant-smelling nicotine particles, and painting alone won’t be enough to undo this effect. Instead, seal your walls first with a primer (like Kilz) and then add your fresh coat of paint after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Launder or steam-clean cloth items, carpet, and furniture in your home.&lt;/strong&gt; Your drapes, chairs, couches, carpet, and more will all absorb the smell of cigarette smoke over time. Giving each of these items a thorough, professional cleaning will give a huge boost to your home’s overall freshness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Trapped odors from cigarette smoke can pose a big problem when it comes time to sell, because non-smoking buyers are sure to notice this residual aroma.%20localhost:4000/today-on-keeping-in-tune-with-market-3.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Trapped odors from cigarette smoke can pose a big problem when it comes time to sell, because non-smoking buyers are sure to notice this residual aroma.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bonus tip: Wipe down flat surfaces, knick-knacks, and light bulbs in your home. You may be surprised to learn that these items can contribute to how your home smells, but the difference that cleaning these things can make will speak for itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Were Thankful for All of You</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2RbeQNFZUpI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this time of year, we think about how much we have to be grateful for. Thanksgiving is a time to give, a time to love, and a time to reflect on things that mean the most in your life. This Thanksgiving, we are especially treasuring the weeks, hours, and minutes of time that we are able to spend with those that we care about. To all of our family, friends, neighbors, clients, and co-workers: We wish you a truly beautiful and bountiful Thanksgiving. We wrote a song called “You Are” that we think fits perfectly this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Keeping In Tune With The Market: Inside the Mind of a FSBO Seller</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jSVAKHPB4Y4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can you, as an agent, convince a For Sale By Owner seller to work with you? It starts by jumping inside the mind of a FSBO seller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;Ask us a question&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/meeting/&quot;&gt;Set up a Skype or coffee meeting&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome back to another episode of “Keeping In Tune With The Market.” Today, we’re going to get inside the mind of a homeowner who wants to list their home as For Sale By Owner (FSBO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you like to get a listing this month? Sure, the market is tight and there’s not very much inventory, so what is the best way for you to get a new listing where you could help a homeowner sell their house?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many agents shy away from FSBO listings because they think that when they go to those homeowners, they’ll get their heads bitten off. That’s actually not the case. By getting inside the head of a FSBO seller, we can understand that they might be a little less scary than you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would a person consider selling their home on their own instead of turning it over to a Realtor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first reason is to save on commission. A lot of them are just confident that they could sell on their own because, perhaps, they’ve sold cars or homes before. They might not know a good agent, or they might have had a bad experience with one. Many FSBO sellers feel as though they have a bottom line to reach and that they can’t afford to pay an agent. In that case, we have to show the owner how we can make them even more money than they could get on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They might also think that if they can’t sell it on their own, then they can just turn it over to an agent. They might give it a few weeks to a couple months to try to sell on their own. In this case, find out what their motivation is. How soon do they need to move? Where are they going? Get an idea of how long they want to try it on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Many agents shy away from FSBO listings because they think that when they go to those homeowners, they’ll get their heads bitten off.%20localhost:4000/keeping-in-tune-with-market-inside-mind.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Many agents shy away from FSBO listings because they think that when they go to those homeowners, they’ll get their heads bitten off.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, they feel like they want to get a particular bottom line. You will really be helpful to them if you can put them in touch with a mortgage broker or a financial expert so they can see how much money they really need from the sale of their house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FSBO sellers aren’t as scary as you think. If you try to get on the other side of the able, get into their heads, and think about what their thought processes are, it might be a little easier for you to approach them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like more information about working with FSBO sellers, I have a couple of trainers who have great plans. Just reach out to me, and I’ll be glad to send you that information. If you’d like to set up a strategy meeting to plan out your business for this year, we can set that up over coffee. I’d love to speak with you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Get More Listings in 2018</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q6n9UEVlYnU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to get more business, there is a key mantra you need to apply. That mantra is, “See. Call. Send.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;Ask us a question&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/meeting/&quot;&gt;Set up a Skype or coffee meeting&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the best ways to get listings?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I’ll be going over three tips you need to know to get more listings in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question you need to ask yourself is, “Who are the best people to get listings from?” A lot of people will say you should look into things like cold calling and door knocking. These things are fine, but the fact is that about 75% of your listings will come from people who already know you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that the majority of listings you get will come from friends, family, co-workers, and other people in your sphere of influence. The people who know you are the ones who will do business with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The people who know you are the ones who will do business with you.%20localhost:4000/how-to-get-more-listings-in-2018.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The people who know you are the ones who will do business with you.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s move on to the three ways to get listings from these people. It all comes down to the mantra: “See. Call. Send.” Let me expand a little on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. See.&lt;/strong&gt; Checking in with the people you know will help you stay connected. It doesn’t always have to be about real estate. The important thing is that you are keeping in touch and maintaining these relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Call.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s important to give the people you know a call every once in a while. The market has gone up dramatically, so consider asking people if they’re curious about their home’s value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Send.&lt;/strong&gt; Distribute newsletters and notifications to people in your sphere of influence via the mail. The mail you send can be informative, educational, and entertaining. While you’re at it, you could even start sending out videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Break Into Real Estate Without Breaking the Bank</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zcMX-xKYHjI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome back to another episode of “Keeping in Tune With the Market.” Today’s question is: How can a new real estate agent break into the business without breaking the bank?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;Ask us a question&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome back to another episode of “Keeping in Tune With the Market.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s question is: How can a new real estate agent break into the business without breaking the bank?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you’ve got your brand-new real estate license and you’re excited to begin. Then, things start popping up. You’re told you must subscribe to this coach or pay for that class. The issue is that all of these kinds of things cost money. But I’m here to tell you that all is not lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get great training for free. It is possible. The first thing I recommend is that you look into a program called RealtyJuggler. When you sign up at www.RealtyJuggler.com you can get a 90-day subscription for free, and it really does the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RealtyJuggler will help you learn how to consistently prospect, stay organized, develop a database, and have a great mindset. There are a lot of great features on the site. In the contact section, you can add all of your friends, relatives, neighbors, coworkers, and anyone else right into your database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve plugged in the email addresses of all of these contacts, you can begin to prospect. I’ve got a couple of resources I’d like to share that can help you do this. First, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mikeferrytv.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.MikeFerryTV.com&lt;/a&gt; is a great, free resource for scripts, dialogue, and training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another place to get information is on Kevin Ward’s video blog. And, of course, we can’t forget Mr. Tom Ferry. Visit his website &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tomferry.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for some great tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have our own career-building video blog, which you can find here. If you would like some training on a particular topic, you can feel free to ask me a question at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Identify and Handle a Stroke</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5aahrDDYNyc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing what to do when you spot a stroke is critical—the right knowledge could save a life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;Ask us a question&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/meeting/&quot;&gt;Set up a Skype or coffee meeting&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to do something a little different for today’s episode of “Keeping in Tune With the Market.” Today, I want to talk about a very serious subject: strokes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you’re with family over the holiday season when suddenly you notice a loved one’s face beginning to droop on one side—one side of their body appears weak and they’re now slurring their speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you do? First, it’s time to call 911. These warning signs should never be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago when my own mother began exhibiting these symptoms, my sisters were thankfully able to recognize the signs and get her immediate medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is critical that people who have had or are having a stroke receive medical attention within the first three hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I have first-hand experience where another family member was not so fortunate. My sister-in-law had a stroke around the same time as my mother. She was out of the town at the time and went to a walk-in clinic where they told her it was probably just her back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Warning signs should never be ignored.%20localhost:4000/how-to-identify-and-handle-stroke.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Warning signs should never be ignored.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They sent her home and she suffered a massive stroke. As a result of not receiving prompt and immediate attention, her injuries will be long-term, if not permanent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be wondering why I’ve chosen to talk about this when my usual subjects relate to real estate. The truth is that real estate is about family and home. That’s why today I chose to share this information with you—to protect your family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to spot and handle a stroke is to remember “F.A.S.T.,” which stands for face drooping, arm weakness, speech difficulty, and time to call 911.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it is you or a family member experiencing these symptoms, do not wait. Getting immediate emergency medical treatment is absolutely key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you and your family stay happy, healthy, and able to enjoy your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;
