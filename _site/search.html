        "content": "If you smoke cigarettes in your home, the odors this habit leaves behind could cause your home sale to go up in smoke. Thankfully, there are three cleaning tips that can help alleviate this issue.Ask us a questionSet up a Skype or coffee meetingIf youâre a cigarette smoker, you may have become smell-blind to the odors this habit can leave behind in your home. This can pose a big problem when it comes time to sell because non-smoking buyers are sure to notice this residual aroma.To make sure cigarette odors donât cause your home sale to go up in smoke, there are three key tips you should follow when you list:1. Have a full professional cleaning of your heating and cooling system. Cigarette smoke will get trapped in your homeâs HVAC unit itself, so simply changing out the air filter wonât be enough if you hope to rid your house of odors. Having a professional clean the ductwork, and the unit itself, will be your ticket to fresh-smelling air.2. Seal and repaint your walls and ceilings. Your homeâs walls and ceilings can trap unpleasant-smelling nicotine particles, and painting alone wonât be enough to undo this effect. Instead, seal your walls first with a primer (like Kilz) and then add your fresh coat of paint after that.3. Launder or steam-clean cloth items, carpet, and furniture in your home. Your drapes, chairs, couches, carpet, and more will all absorb the smell of cigarette smoke over time. Giving each of these items a thorough, professional cleaning will give a huge boost to your homeâs overall freshness.âTrapped odors from cigarette smoke can pose a big problem when it comes time to sell, because non-smoking buyers are sure to notice this residual aroma.âAs a bonus tip: Wipe down flat surfaces, knick-knacks, and light bulbs in your home. You may be surprised to learn that these items can contribute to how your home smells, but the difference that cleaning these things can make will speak for itself.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "How can you, as an agent, convince a For Sale By Owner seller to work with you? It starts by jumping inside the mind of a FSBO seller.Ask us a questionSet up a Skype or coffee meetingWelcome back to another episode of âKeeping In Tune With The Market.â Today, weâre going to get inside the mind of a homeowner who wants to list their home as For Sale By Owner (FSBO).Would you like to get a listing this month? Sure, the market is tight and thereâs not very much inventory, so what is the best way for you to get a new listing where you could help a homeowner sell their house?Many agents shy away from FSBO listings because they think that when they go to those homeowners, theyâll get their heads bitten off. Thatâs actually not the case. By getting inside the head of a FSBO seller, we can understand that they might be a little less scary than you think.Why would a person consider selling their home on their own instead of turning it over to a Realtor?The first reason is to save on commission. A lot of them are just confident that they could sell on their own because, perhaps, theyâve sold cars or homes before. They might not know a good agent, or they might have had a bad experience with one. Many FSBO sellers feel as though they have a bottom line to reach and that they canât afford to pay an agent. In that case, we have to show the owner how we can make them even more money than they could get on their own.They might also think that if they canât sell it on their own, then they can just turn it over to an agent. They might give it a few weeks to a couple months to try to sell on their own. In this case, find out what their motivation is. How soon do they need to move? Where are they going? Get an idea of how long they want to try it on their own.âMany agents shy away from FSBO listings because they think that when they go to those homeowners, theyâll get their heads bitten off.âLastly, they feel like they want to get a particular bottom line. You will really be helpful to them if you can put them in touch with a mortgage broker or a financial expert so they can see how much money they really need from the sale of their house.FSBO sellers arenât as scary as you think. If you try to get on the other side of the able, get into their heads, and think about what their thought processes are, it might be a little easier for you to approach them.If youâd like more information about working with FSBO sellers, I have a couple of trainers who have great plans. Just reach out to me, and Iâll be glad to send you that information. If youâd like to set up a strategy meeting to plan out your business for this year, we can set that up over coffee.

Send.âAsk us a questionSet up a Skype or coffee meetingWhat are the best ways to get listings?Today, Iâll be going over three tips you need to know to get more listings in 2018.The first question you need to ask yourself is, âWho are the best people to get listings from?â A lot of people will say you should look into things like cold calling and door knocking. These things are fine, but the fact is that about 75% of your listings will come from people who already know you.This means that the majority of listings you get will come from friends, family, co-workers, and other people in your sphere of influence. The people who know you are the ones who will do business with you.âThe people who know you are the ones who will do business with you.âNow, letâs move on to the three ways to get listings from these people. It all comes down to the mantra: âSee. Call. Send.â Let me expand a little on this.1. See. Checking in with the people you know will help you stay connected. It doesnât always have to be about real estate. The important thing is that you are keeping in touch and maintaining these relationships.2. Call. Itâs important to give the people you know a call every once in a while. The market has gone up dramatically, so consider asking people if theyâre curious about their homeâs value.3. Send. Distribute newsletters and notifications to people in your sphere of influence via the mail. The mail you send can be informative, educational, and entertaining. While youâre at it, you could even start sending out videos.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Knowing what to do when you spot a stroke is criticalâthe right knowledge could save a life.Ask us a questionSet up a Skype or coffee meetingI wanted to do something a little different for todayâs episode of âKeeping in Tune With the Market.â Today, I want to talk about a very serious subject: strokes.Imagine youâre with family over the holiday season when suddenly you notice a loved oneâs face beginning to droop on one sideâone side of their body appears weak and theyâre now slurring their speech.What do you do? First, itâs time to call 911. These warning signs should never be ignored.Two weeks ago when my own mother began exhibiting these symptoms, my sisters were thankfully able to recognize the signs and get her immediate medical treatment.It is critical that people who have had or are having a stroke receive medical attention within the first three hours.Unfortunately, I have first-hand experience where another family member was not so fortunate. My sister-in-law had a stroke around the same time as my mother. She was out of the town at the time and went to a walk-in clinic where they told her it was probably just her back.âWarning signs should never be ignored.âThey sent her home and she suffered a massive stroke. As a result of not receiving prompt and immediate attention, her injuries will be long-term, if not permanent.You may be wondering why Iâve chosen to talk about this when my usual subjects relate to real estate. The truth is that real estate is about family and home. Thatâs why today I chose to share this information with youâto protect your family.The easiest way to spot and handle a stroke is to remember âF.A.S.T.,â which stands for face drooping, arm weakness, speech difficulty, and time to call 911.Whether it is you or a family member experiencing these symptoms, do not wait. Getting immediate emergency medical treatment is absolutely key.I hope you and your family stay happy, healthy, and able to enjoy your home.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "If you have a seller whose house needs work, there are five tactful ways to get them to do what you want.Ask us a questionSet up a Skype or coffee meetingToday I want to talk about five tricks you can use to get a seller to do what you want. Well, theyâre not really âtricksâ â theyâre more like tips.Letâs say you have a seller and you know there are things on their house that need to be changed or fixed. Either you saw them when you first walked in the door, they were brought to your attention as time went by and you looked closer at the property, or a fellow Realtor brought it up to you during an inspection. In any case, should you lay it all on the seller with your bottom line very sternly and risk them getting annoyed with you?âHelp your seller feel that youâre understanding.âThatâs probably not the best way of doing things. There are five ways to be more tactful:1. Be compassionate. You might not know what the situation is with that particular seller. They may be getting divorced, going through a job transfer, dealing with a death in the family, etc. If you do know, you need to be compassionate, give them a little space, and help them feel that youâre understanding.2. Create a to-do list. I had a seller recently whose house wasnât too bad, but we got a lot of feedback about its patio and yard being unkempt. Instead of just telling them they had to do some repainting and lay some sod down, we sat down with them and made a to-do list. They were on board with it, and they did most of the things on that list.3. Involve the seller. Ask them what they think they can do to help with the process.4. Suggest some low-cost alternatives. Maybe itâs just a paint job and some power washing. Maybe you know a handyman who can help them. Maybe they need a low-cost storage unit to help them declutter.5. Offer options. If there is a seller who is elderly and canât make the necessary repairs, then you make an alternative solution such as a credit at the closing. This way they wonât have to do a lot of work if they feel as though they donât have the energy or the monetary wherewithal.If you have any questions about this topic, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to seeing you at the next episode of âKeeping in Tune With the Market.â Until then, make it a great day!",

Make your offer as competitive as you can without going over your budget. If youâre going with a higher financing amount, you must be competitive against someone who might be putting more cash into the deal. Also, make sure you have your pre-approval letter and that you submit it at the same time you put your offer in. Your offer must be as strong as possible.2. Find out from the other agent or owner what their hot buttons are. In other words, does the owner want a quick closing or do they need extra time? When you structure your offer, make sure to add that in. Does the owner have a special appliance they want to take with them? Stress that the appliance can go with the owner and you donât insist on having it stay.3. Write a personal note from the heart. This one is my secret weapon. When you do this, find out a little bit about the owner and share with them some information about your family and how you will love the home as much as they did. If you have a cute little kid or puppy, include pictures of them in the note.âYour offer must be as strong as possible.âIf you have a real estate question thatâs on your mind, donât hesitate to email it to me. If I answer it in a future video, youâll receive a $10 gift card. Until next time, make it a great day!",

Texting is a great way to get an immediate response from potential clients.Ask us a questionSet up a Skype or coffee meetingIf youâre like me, as you approach the end of the year, you might think that you are running out of steam or youâre running out of people in your pipeline. However, you still want to finish the year strong. One way you can still end 2016 on a high note is to incorporate texting for dollars.I donât know about you, but if I get an email, I put it in my line of emails that I have to reply to and I might get to it or I might not. If I get a voicemail, the same thing happens. Sometimes my voicemails wait awhile for a response. But what about a text?A text is immediate. People always have their phones on and people will see it right away. How do you text for dollars? Here is an example of a text you could send out:âHi Janet. The marketâs really moving and prices are going up, up, up. Are you curious about your homeâs value or know someone who needs my help???â Then, hit send! Hopefully, Janet will give me a call.The fact of the matter is people are curious about their homeâs value. Texting for dollars is a great way to get a CMA to someone who might be thinking about making a move this year or next year.âA text is immediate.âWho should you text? Anyone in your database who bought a house 10 years ago. Back then, the market was up kind of high, but it went down. Now the market is almost back to where it was, and it might be time for those homeowners to consider selling again because they should have enough equity to do so.You should also text people who are thinking about retiring. A lot of people in the older age bracket pride themselves on being able to text, so this is a great opportunity to reach out to them.In short, texting for dollars is a great way to finish the year strong. If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. Donât forget to submit your questions for our next video; send me one and you will enter the contest for a $25 gift certificate.

        "content": "I received an email from a colleague the other day and it was so upsetting that I thought, âWow, we have to talk about how to avoid the heartbreak of major mortgage mistakes.âAsk us a questionSet up a Skype or coffee meetingThis buyer had been in the army and felt that he âhadnât had a place to call home since.â He was about to close on the property when the lender sent an email requesting more paperwork, pushing the closing back another month.The buyer had sent in his application on time and paid for inspections and appraisals. Unfortunately, the lender never sent the application to underwriting. When the buyer asked why everything took so long, the lender cited staffing issues. Because of this, the buyer didnât have a home to move into when his lease was up. As the buyer said, this finance company failed.How do we as buyers, sellers, or Realtors avoid major mortgage headaches like this?First of all, make sure you work with a local, reputable lender. Get recommendations from friends and colleagues. Hire someone who has done many transactions. Please, donât search online for lenders and hire one from a different state. They wonât know any appraisers in our area, and that can only lead to headaches.âWork with a reputable local lender.âMake sure that the money the buyer needs to close is in the bank. That means they have enough to cover the downpayment and closing costs. Also, make sure they know not to run up additional debts by purchasing a car or furniture between contract and closing; doing so will also cause trouble with your mortgage.Finally, make sure that you call your lender with any questions. Make sure the buyer is pre-approved, not just pre-qualified. As a Realtor, it is your responsibility to make sure all lines of communication are open.If you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!",

I can move it around, take it down, and bring it home with me.You add your laptop or computer monitor to the top shelf, and add a wireless keyboard to the bottom one. It goes on top of your desk or other surface, transforming your previous workspace into something trendy and healthy. When you start working, you can turn your computer on and are ready to go. Youâre already eye-level with your computer. Your arms and shoulders feel relaxed, since you arenât scrunched into a sitting position.When youâre talking to clients, you have a lot more energy and flexibility when youâre standing.
