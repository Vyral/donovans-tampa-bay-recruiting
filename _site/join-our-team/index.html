<p>Dear Fellow Realtor,

<p>Have you been a real estate agent for a year or two, or perhaps even a little while longer, and feel like you have been giving it your best shot? Maybe you’ve had a little bit of success. Maybe you have gotten a couple of leads and taken some training (which you probably paid for paid out of your own pocket), but even after that success, you might still feel as if you’ve hit a “brick wall,” with even less than nothing to show for your efforts.</p>

<p><strong>The problem is that you haven’t been earning while you are learning,</strong> which can lead you to feel increasingly frustrated and “lost in the shuffle.” This is especially the case when you see a ton of other hungry agents all competing for the same business with the same line!</p>

<p>Your broker or manager probably tells you that the way to make it in the real estate business is to spend more money. They might encourage you to do things like pay for a coach, spend all day on the phones or out in the field contacting For Sale By Owners, and use money from your own pocket to buy “paid” leads that everybody else in the industry has, too! <strong>This means it’s likely you’ll have to spend more money out of the paycheck you don’t have to “Buy Your Business!”</strong></p>

<p>So you start thinking: <strong>“There’s got to be a better way.”</strong> You do some research on the internet only to become more confused by every real estate trainer or webinar that comes your way.</p>

<p><strong>But, you’ve got to figure this out. What you thought was a dream job is now quickly turning into a nightmare, leaving you with no money and no plan in sight.</strong></p>

<p>At this point in your career, you could do one of three things:
<ul class="indent">
<li>Quit the business and find a new career</li>
<li>Stay where you are and continue to hope and wish that maybe you’ll get lucky</li>
<li>Or, move to another “club house”</li>
</ul></p>

<p>By the way, you know a Volkswagen Beetle doesn’t become a Mercedes just because it’s parked in a different garage! If your present model isn’t working, it’s critical that you consider changing it. Don’t just move your old model from one garage to another! <strong>If you want something you don’t have now, you have to become somebody else!</strong></p>

<p>But wait! There is a 4th alternative to consider.</p>

<p>Why not explore the possibility of embracing a new “operating model”? We’ve developed a tried and proven model that <strong>gets results!</strong> Here are the stories of three agents who put our Operating Model to the test:
<ol class="indent">
<li>L.C came to us as a brand new agent from another field. She was burned out and her self-esteem was at zero. She asked if we felt she had a chance and indicated she was “all in.” She had nowhere else to turn! By the end of her first full year, she was nominated for “Rookie of the Year,” and her 1099 for 2016 showed an income of $101.856 during what was only her second year of business!</li>
<li>S.M. came to us from a franchised “big box” company. He got tons of training and went to plenty of classes. After all, that’s what they are known for! But after a year and a half, he only had two deals under his belt and never got a lick of help from a manager. He had to figure everything out for himself. In one short year with us, he had 17 deals! Thanks to our team concept and coaching, he’s on his way to hitting his stride this year!</li>
<li>Then, there was A.F., who had been in real estate for five years but relocated to a new area with no contacts and no leads. She had to start from scratch. We taught her how to “fish,” showing her techniques to snag ready, willing, and able buyers and reel them in. Her 4th month in, she closed five transactions in one month!</li>
</ol></p>

<p><strong>Our names are Joe and Karen Donovan, and we’ve built two successful real estate companies over the past 30 years.</strong> We’ve sold lots of homes (even in the face of THREE major real estate depressions). We’ve made a lot of money in our careers, we can relate to your pain. We’ve seen firsthand the difficulties faced by agents who have come to us from other companies.</p>

<p>We’re writing to tell you not to give up! <strong>We have a vision and a mission that we believe can help you achieve a kind of lifestyle which might have seemed illusory up until today!</strong> You see, we believe success is repeatable. We’ve got a recipe for growth that can help get you on a tried-and-true track to success. We will also provide you with the tools and technology you’ll need to stay on that track, as well as a total support team to fill the gaps, hold you accountable, and offer tips, techniques, encouragement, and guidance towards achieving your goals.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be great to feel like you are charge of your life again? Consider becoming part of an energized team that provides:
<ul class="indent">
<li>Clear-cut, practical, and profitable objectives.</li>
<li>Plenty of opportunity to practice your performance and perfect your techniques.</li>
<li>A growing feeling of competence, confidence, and skills to help you play your roll on a team.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Yes, you can transform your life and you can become that new, successful person. Here’s how:</p>

<p>We have a proven <strong>30-Day Fast Track Program</strong> that will help get you up and running, and consistently hitting a minimum of two deals per month within six months – often in less than 90 days!</p>

<p>But it all starts with you. Call us to take that first step and get your dreams back on track. <strong>Achieving big dream doesn’t happen overnight, but you can take the first step on that journey right now.</strong></p>

<p>Call us now to:
<ul class="indent">
<li>Get the facts, the numbers, and the game plan.</li>
<li>Learn how our field training program can bridge the gap between learning and earning.</li>
<li>Fill your pipeline with prospects using our free website and backend dashboard</li>
<li>Create a 90-day plan of action to get your career on track.</li>
<li>Have one signed listing agreement by the end of your first month! (Yes, it can be done!)</li>
</ul></p>


<p>Don’t delay – call us to learn more about our <strong>TRIED AND TRUE TRACK FOR REAL ESTATE SUCCESS.</strong> The key is in your hands. The information is free. What have you got to lose?</p>

<p>Looking forward to hearing from you soon,</p>

<p>Joe &amp; Karen Donovan</p>

<p>P.S. Only apply if you have a passion for excellence and are willing to work hard and be trained.</p>
