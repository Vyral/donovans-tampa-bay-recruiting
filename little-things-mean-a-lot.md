**Good Morning\! &nbsp;**

**'I like to compare the holiday season with the way a child listens to a favorite story. The pleasure is in the familiar way the story begins, the anticipation of familiar turns it takes, the familiar moments of suspense, and the familiar climax and ending."[&nbsp;Fred Rogers](https://t.e2ma.net/click/v5r7ld/zwff20l/3r6f2e){: target="_blank"}**

**This week, I want to share a heartwarming story about how the Poinsettia became associated with Christmas:**

**According to folklore, there was a young girl named Pepita on her way to Christmas Mass. She had nothing for an offering, so she picked weeds on the side of the road, made a bouquet and brought them with her to church. Upon entering the church, the tips of the branches turned into bright red flowers. It was seen as a miracle, and from then on, they were known as the&nbsp;[“Flores de Noche Buena”](https://t.e2ma.net/click/v5r7ld/zwff20l/jk7f2e){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;or “Flowers of the Holy Night”. They are a beautiful reminder that even the smallest act of giving is treasured.&nbsp;**
