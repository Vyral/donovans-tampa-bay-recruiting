In these stressful times, have you ever been so obsessed with "doing" that you couldn't stop to just&nbsp; "be"? After all, we are human "beings" not human "doings".&nbsp; A most interesting post came to my attention about the Dutch art of "Niksen" which, translated actually means the art of "nothing ing" in the Dutch language.&nbsp; Niksen allows us to step back from whatever we are doing to just let everything be as it is without being an active participant in it. Ideally, practicing niksen and allowing your brain to wander - frees up space we use to "day dream" so that all the energy we usually use to focus to frantically getting everything done is freed up. We literally get some space to be more productive after taking a little time to "do nothing" and it may even allow us to then get back to our busy lives with a calmer, less frenetic approach\!&nbsp; If the art of doing nothing intrigues you - check out this post on the topic by Olga Mecking -&nbsp;**[The Dutch art of "Niksen](https://t.e2ma.net/click/ykee7c/y0qeoac/aykx8i){: target="_blank"}".**

**Something to Think About**

A possible challenge with "doing nothing" is there are really no steps involved\! It is deceptively simple. You just have to try it and keep trying it so that in time, you naturally relax into it. If you are not sure where to begin, start by staring out a window or sitting outside simply looking at a tree or something in nature. Then, just let your thoughts go where they will. In our culture, we are extremely uncomfortable with just "being". Put away your phone, your computer and turn off the TV. We could all benefit from a little more "niksen"\!
