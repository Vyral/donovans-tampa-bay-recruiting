**WORD OF THE WEEK&nbsp;[INSPIRATIONAL](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inspiration)**

**Good Morning Friends,**

**Our word for this week is ‚ÄúInspirational‚Äù. &nbsp;Can you think of someone who has inspired you? If you had someone like that in your life; a role model, a parent, a teacher? Then, consider yourself fortunate.**

**I recently had the pleasure of seeing a short video by Robert Reich, who is a professor, lawyer, author, political commentator, educator and former U.S. Secretary of Labor. For those of you not familiar with his story, he suffered from a childhood disease that caused him to grow to only 4‚Äô11‚Äù. As a youngster, you can only imagine the taunting and bullying he suffered. He was insecure, felt like a loser and had no&nbsp; particular interest in&nbsp; school. Then in 3rd grade, he had the good fortune of having a teacher by the name of Alice Camp. She encouraged, praised, challenged and inspired Robert to use the talents he was given to become the leader and inspiration that he is today. He goes on to say that he never got to thank Mrs. Camp for the life changing role she played in his life and that he will be forever grateful to her and several other inspirational teachers in his life.

**What about you? If you ever had such a person in your life ‚Äì why not take time out of your week to write a short note and thank them for the role they played?&nbsp; Or, if that is not possible, how about thinking up some way to pass that gift on and being an inspiration to someone else?&nbsp; Make it a great and inspirational week\!**
