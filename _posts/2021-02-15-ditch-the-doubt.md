Shakespeare said it best when he said, “Our doubts are our traitors.” Life is filled with many opportunities, as well as twists and turns.&nbsp; Some hold great promise, while others wreak havoc along the way, but the only way to know which opportunities are the ones that will serve you is to stay focused on the goal. Many people fill their life with busyness instead of focus. Focus is the key in any successful endeavor and gives you the ability to keep doubt at bay by being mindful of how you respond. Your doubts do not serve you, so fill your mind with possibilities instead. Go for the open door rather than search for all the reasons why something won't work. Stay focused on the actions that produce results and let the doubts fall away. Want to get the whole scoop?&nbsp;[**CLICK HERE&nbsp; for:&nbsp; "11 No B.S.
