**Hello\!**

**Did you know it’s National Get Organized Week? With the start of school behind us and the holidays before us, I guess that makes perfect sense\! Clutter and disorganization can not only wreak havoc on our schedules and ability to get things accomplished, they can also add to our sense of unease and discomfort as things “left undone” create anxiety for many.**

**I went on a search of some of the best ways to get organized, feel on top of your game, and decrease the clutter in your life. From tossing unused items, to creating a space for everything (and everything in its place as they say), to time-blocking your days to clean, I loved many of the 100+ ideas shared in an article from&nbsp;*Good Housekeeping Magazine*. &nbsp;[CLICK HERE&nbsp;](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/tips/g2610/best-organizing-tips/){: target="_blank"}**

**Make it a great week and remember - “A place for everything and everything in its place\!“&nbsp;**
