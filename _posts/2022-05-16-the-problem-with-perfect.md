***“The perfect is the enemy of the good."&nbsp;[Voltaire](https://t.e2ma.net/click/ykeujh/q6p3gvi/mn0j8p){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;***

**If you find that you are doing something in your life because you "have to do it" or you “ought to do it”, this could signal that you may be a&nbsp;[perfectionist](https://t.e2ma.net/click/ykeujh/q6p3gvi/i81j8p){: target="_blank"}. The problem with forcing yourself to do something out of obligation, guilt, or fear is that instead of being glad you did that thing or accomplished that goal, you only feel depressed, demoralized, and demotivated.**

**Why should this be so? For some, it’s a small voice in their head, put there by&nbsp;[nature or nurture&nbsp;](https://t.e2ma.net/click/ykeujh/q6p3gvi/et3j8p){: target="_blank"}– the jury is still out on that. But whether you inherited this trait from one of your parents or learned it through example,&nbsp; there is no denying the fact that they have a tendency to have high standards and goals and are very hard on themselves and others around them when failure inevitably occurs.**

**While there is nothing wrong with being a high achiever, however, being a perfectionist sometimes leads to stress, depression and just plain old getting worn out by trying to be “Perfect”\!**

**What is the antidote to perfectionism?&nbsp; Lots of perfectionists are afraid to let go and fearful that they will become "mediocre".&nbsp; (My perfectionist friend likes to call it fear of being stuck "in the middle of the class.")**

**I’m here to tell you that there are some tricks to help you take your perfectionism level down a notch or two.&nbsp; (If it is you, or share this with a friend or loved one if it is them\!)**

**1\. First, if you get the urge to keep at something until it’s ‘perfect’ – think about the 80/20 rule (called the&nbsp;[Pareto Principal](https://t.e2ma.net/click/ykeujh/q6p3gvi/ae5j8p){: target="_blank"}), which means basically that roughly 20% of your actions or activities will account for 80% of your success.&nbsp; In other words, if you feel you need to fix something that others would feel is “finished”.&nbsp; Ask yourself – Is this task in the top 20% of my activities or at the bottom 80%? Then try focusing on the top 20% of what you are doing and stop paying so much attention to the lower 80%.**

**2\. Learn to look at your mistakes as golden learning opportunities. If you &nbsp;get everything right – most people won’t even notice that you got every single little detail right.&nbsp; If you get everything almost right – most people won’t even notice that you got something a little wrong\! You could save yourself a lot of time and heartache.&nbsp; The added benefit is when you make mistakes,&nbsp; this also becomes a golden learning opportunity to learn from your mistakes. (which is only human).&nbsp; As sales trainer&nbsp;[Tom Hopkins](https://t.e2ma.net/click/ykeujh/q6p3gvi/6y6j8p){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;says: “I never see failure as failure itself but as an opportunity to perfect my performance and practice my techniques.”**

**3\. Last but not least, never forget - “the joy is in the journey”. As you travel along this road we call life, while it’s good to be successful and achieve great results from your actions, it’s also good to stop and smell the roses, sing your song and do those things on your bucket list that you’ve been putting off.&nbsp; &nbsp;As my dad used to say – life is short – start with&nbsp;[dessert](https://t.e2ma.net/click/ykeujh/q6p3gvi/2j8j8p){: target="_blank"}\! for dessert for breakfast recipes&nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://t.e2ma.net/click/ykeujh/q6p3gvi/y49j8p){: target="_blank"}**
