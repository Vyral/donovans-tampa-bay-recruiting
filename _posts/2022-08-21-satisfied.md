**INSPIRATION FOR YOUR WEEK AHEAD:**

**WORD OF THE WEEK&nbsp;[SATISFIED\!](https://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/are-you-satisfied-with-life-and-happiness-test_1#:~:text=1.%20In%20most%20ways%2C%20my%20life%20is%20close,positive%29%203.%20I%20am%20satisfied%20with%20my%20life.)**

***"True contentment is not having everything but in being satisfied with everything you have.&nbsp;*[Helen Keller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller#:~:text=Helen%20Adams%20Keller%20%28contracted%20English%20Braille%3A%20%E2%A0%A0%E2%A0%93%E2%A0%91%E2%A0%87%E2%A0%A2%E2%A0%80%E2%A0%A0%E2%A0%85%E2%A0%91%E2%A0%87%E2%A0%87%E2%A0%BB%3B%20American,of%20illness%20at%20the%20age%20of%2019%20months.)**

**Good Morning Friends,**

**What does it mean to be Satisfied?&nbsp; Merriam-Webster dictionary defines it as: ‚Äúbeing contented, not feeling the need for anything more,‚Äù while the Oxford Dictionary defines satisfied as ‚Äúa good feeling that you have achieved something or when something that you wanted to happen does happen.&nbsp; For example: She looked back on her career with great satisfaction.**

**How satisfied are you? &nbsp;Take the 5 question quiz:&nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/are-you-satisfied-with-life-and-happiness-test_1#:~:text=1.%20In%20most%20ways%2C%20my%20life%20is%20close,positive%29%203.%20I%20am%20satisfied%20with%20my%20life.)**

**True satisfaction does not mean always getting everything you want, but it does mean being able to deal with the ups and downs of life and turning those ‚Äúchallenges‚Äù into ways you can accomplish something in your life.**

**Here are 3 things that people who consider themselves ‚Äúsatisfied‚Äù do on almost a daily basis:**

**1\. They have realistic expectations: They are aware of their strengths and weaknesses. They set lofty goals and are willing to give their all, but also realize they have limits and aren‚Äôt afraid to ask for help or collaborate with others when the need arises.**

**2\. They are givers: Satisfied people place a value on helping others and giving back. They realize that life is not a competition so much as valuing the fact that when they make a contribution to a less fortunate person, it makes the world a better place\!**

**3\. Truly satisfied people know that sometimes they need to let something go in order to move forward: If they have made an effort with their time, energy or money and after giving ‚Äútheir best‚Äù a pursuit is still going in a negative direction, they aren‚Äôt afraid to call it a day and move on. &nbsp;As a good friend of mine once said,&nbsp;[‚ÄúLet it Go\!](https://youtu.be/L0MK7qz13bU?t=72)"&nbsp;**

**During the past two years, we have certainly seen great examples of people being content with the simple things in life. &nbsp;As Helen Keller once said, ‚ÄúTrue contentment is not having everything, but in being satisfied with everything you have\!‚Äù&nbsp;**
