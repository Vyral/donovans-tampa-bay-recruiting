“I find that being under a night sky is indescribably wonderful… It refreshes my mind in a way that nothing else does. “ – Tim Cole Astronomy educator and sky enthusiast. For More:&nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://youtu.be/8EHuof1lrx8)

**Good Morning\!&nbsp;**

**As we near the end of summer, I thought it would be fun to share something I just learned about the “*Dog Days of Summer”*&nbsp;which officially came to an end last week.**

**These are traditionally the 40 days beginning July 3 and ending August 11. This time frame coincides with the morning rise of the Dog Star, Sirius. Long ago people thought that the “combined heat” of Sirius and the Sun caused summer’s roasting temperatures. According to&nbsp;*The Old Farmer’s Almanac for Kids*, Sirius is the brightest star in the sky, other than the Sun. Under the right conditions, it can even be seen with the naked eye during the day. Sirius is one star in a group of stars that form the constellation Canis Major, meaning “Greater Dog.” It’s no surprise, then, that the nickname of this big, bold star is Dog Star. To find Canis Major: Imagine a straight line through Orion’s belt. Move your eyes left (south) until you come to a very bright star—that’s Sirius, the nose of the dog. Look further south to find a triangle of stars that marks the dog’s hindquarters. I hope you enjoy a little late summer stargazing\! &nbsp;For a quick video tip on how to discover Canis Major:&nbsp;****[CLICK HERE](https://youtu.be/fqwJf_iumlQ?t=27)**
