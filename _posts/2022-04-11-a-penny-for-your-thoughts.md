***“Give me the courage to solve the problems that can be solved, the serenity to accept the problems that can't be solved and the wisdom to know the difference." -&nbsp;[Russ Harris](https://t.e2ma.net/click/3ra7td/jw4ppix/nfio9e){: target="_blank"}***

**When someone says, “[A penny for your thoughts](https://t.e2ma.net/click/3ra7td/jw4ppix/37io9e){: target="_blank"}”, what they want to know is what you are really thinking about. It is an old saying, an idiom, from long ago English of the mid 1500’s. It meant when someone was quiet for a while and they had a pensive or “far-away” look in their eyes; "what are you thinking about"?&nbsp; &nbsp;Its kind of similar to our modern day expression...“Earth to John - come in please”, when we are trying to get someone’s attention who seems lost in space\!**

**Speaking of thoughts, in our “[Happiness Trap](https://t.e2ma.net/click/3ra7td/jw4ppix/j0jo9e){: target="_blank"}” study, author Russ Harris speaks about how to control your thoughts.&nbsp; You know how? The answer is ...we can’t\!**

**Did you ever try to stop thinking a thought (either positive or negative)?&nbsp; You try positive thinking or distracting yourself or telling yourself not to think about that thought… but the more you try, you realize that “[resistance is futile](https://t.e2ma.net/click/3ra7td/jw4ppix/zsko9e){: target="_blank"}”. &nbsp;From our study of the Happiness Trap, we discover that the only way to co-exist with negative thoughts is by giving them space, acknowledging them and then focusing on what we really want, despite those thoughts still being there.**

**Take for example, one of the most uncomfortable thoughts of all time: the fear of public speaking or public performance. Even famous people, when asked if they still get “butterflies or stage fright” attest that this feeling never goes away\! So how do you cope with unpleasant or uncomfortable thoughts that apparently can’t be banished?&nbsp; I heard an interesting example from&nbsp;[Bob Weir](https://t.e2ma.net/click/3ra7td/jw4ppix/fllo9e){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;– you may or may not have heard of him.&nbsp; He was one of the guitar legends of the “Grateful Dead”.&nbsp; Bob suffered from horrendous stage fright, but this was how he dealt with it: he simply focused on the songs he was performing and the messages of the characters in the stories. He says that the more he gives of himself to this message the less time he has to focus on his stage fright\!**

**Is it time to let go of the struggle and focus on enjoying the journey? … A penny for your thoughts?**
