**WORD OF THE WEEK&nbsp;[WINNER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvtApEeAZCs)**

**&nbsp;*"Winning doesn't always mean being first. Winning means you're doing better than you've ever done before."-&nbsp;[Bonnie Blair.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_Blair)***

**Good Morning Friends,**

**What does it mean to be a “winner”? &nbsp;Does it mean that you are the smartest, the fastest, the most diligent or the luckiest in each thing you do?&nbsp; What if you come in second place or third place or, god forbid, you only get honorable mention?**

**Whether winner or runner up, our outlook and our attitude and what we learn from our experience, determines who we become over time.**

**I am reminded of a funny song by Mary Chapin Carpenter; “Sometimes you’re the windshield, sometimes you’re the bug…. Sometimes you’re the Louisville Slugger, sometimes you’re the ball.”**

**We saw this scenario play out this week in concession speeches all over our country. Many candidates were gracious and appreciative of the support they had, they had run a good race, they held their heads up high and wished the winner well.**

**Hey, we have to admit it, sometimes we cannot control the outcome of how something turns out. Things happen, we get a bad break, someone else was just better, or more talented, but in the end, as I once wrote in&nbsp; one of my own songs: “When my time has come, it’s the race that I have run, not what I keep but what I give away.”**

**Lesson learned this week: you are a winner if you aren’t afraid to give it your best shot, go all in, play the game, run the race, learn from your mistakes and don't compare yourself to anyone else other than trying to improve upon your last performance.&nbsp; Even if it turns out you are the “bug” instead of the windshield, as a famous basketball coach once said: "At least give it a shot, because you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take\!”**
