For the last 9 months, we have quite literally been bombarded by images and influences daily. Some that fuel us and spark joy, peace, and a feeling of self-worth -- and many others, that create fear, anxiety, worry, and stress. Especially in a world that is so heatedly divisive right now. The cool thing is that we get to choose what we let in. We get to pick what we allow to influence our energy. There’s an old saying, “You wouldn’t allow a thief into your home, so why would you allow thoughts that steal your joy make a home in your mind?” Let that sink in for a second.

Despite the fact that most of us have our cell phones in hand 24/7, social media at our fingertips, and an ever-present barrage of negative news available – what if, just for a little while every day this month we put it all down? What if we unplugged a little bit and really focused on being in the present with the people in our lives and the positive influences that make us smile and curate joy? It will all be there when we pick it back up again – so no danger we’re really going to miss anything\! Except we might just&nbsp;[**lower our blood pressure**](https://t.e2ma.net/click/66ghbd/y0qeoac/2fdtnj){: target="_blank"}, laugh a little more, and enjoy our time with the people we love a little more.

**DIY Tip for the Week**

Talk about a&nbsp;**"short fuse"**\! Here is something that is actually good to shorten\! Your dryer-vent hose\! First, disconnect it and vacuum it out. Then trim the hose length so that it's just long enough for you to pull the dryer a few feet out from the wall. A short and unobstructed line makes your dryer run more efficiently. Cost: Free. Savings: $25 a year on electric, gas, or propane. See how to clean out a dryer vent hose.&nbsp;[**Click HERE**](https://t.e2ma.net/click/66ghbd/y0qeoac/y0etnj){: target="_blank"}

**Words of Wisdom**

Especially when you have a lot going on, you must find a way to unplug and focus on yourself. *Mandy Ingber*

The biggest thing I try to do is to unplug and give myself time away from social media and the Internet. *Franchesca Ramsey*

The more ways we have to connect, the more many of us seem desperate to unplug. *Pico Iyer*

In this media-drenched, multitasking, always-on age, many of us have forgotten how to unplug and immerse ourselves completely in the moment. We have forgotten how to slow down. Not surprisingly, this fast-forward culture is taking a toll on everything from our diet and health to our work and the environment. *Carl Honore*

These days, unplugged places are getting hard to find. *Richard Louv****&nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **
