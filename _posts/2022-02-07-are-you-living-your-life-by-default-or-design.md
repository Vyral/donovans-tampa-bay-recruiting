***"Make your life a masterpiece: Step beyond the demands of the moment and begin right now to design and live the life you deserve.&nbsp;[Tony Robbins](https://t.e2ma.net/click/rqpkpd/zwff20l/3v1e5e){: target="_blank"}***

**Good Morning\! &nbsp;**

**Have you ever had a situation where someone was talking to you and then you realized you were a million miles away? Or did you ever drive home from work, only to wonder how you got home? Would you be surprised to know that about 40% of what we do each day is on&nbsp;[autopilot](https://t.e2ma.net/click/rqpkpd/zwff20l/f93e5e){: target="_blank"}?**

**Now automatic responses and habits are not all bad. Scientific studies show that the average human being needs to make about&nbsp;[35,000 decisions a day\!](https://t.e2ma.net/click/rqpkpd/zwff20l/v14e5e){: target="_blank"}&nbsp; Our brains can’t possibly take time to consider every single thing we do or we’d freeze up with “over-load”\! It’s a good thing that we don’t have to make conscious decisions everyday about doing such things as eating, sleeping, getting dressed & tying our shoes\! Imagine if we had to consciously think through these mundane yet important activities daily\!**

**On the other hand, we still have another 60% of life decisions that we need to carefully think about and ponder before acting upon them\! Imagine if you just “[went along with the crowd](https://t.e2ma.net/click/rqpkpd/zwff20l/bu5e5e){: target="_blank"}” on such important life decisions as choosing a mate or forming friendships, deciding what kind of job to take, picking where you are going to live or deciding on your values.&nbsp;**

**Here are 3 short questions you can ask yourself to help you become more skillful at living your life by design instead of default.**

**1\. Ask yourself, “Where do I want to be personally and professionally in one year from now?” Be honest, if you are unhappy, ask yourself what needs to change so that a year from now you are living the life you have designed. For example, if its food, what are the types of foods that you would still enjoy that you know are more&nbsp;[healthy than some of the foods you are eating now?](https://t.e2ma.net/click/rqpkpd/zwff20l/rm6e5e){: target="_blank"}**

**2\. Hit the pause button. Whenever you feel you are moving in the wrong direction. Ask yourself the question “is what I’m doing going to take me towards what is important in my life?” If not, its time to stop what you are doing and ask yourself “what can I do to get back on track toward following my values?” (Following the food example from before – what about&nbsp;[cleaning out your food pantry and getting rid of the items you know you no longer want to eat?)](https://t.e2ma.net/click/rqpkpd/zwff20l/7e7e5e){: target="_blank"}**

**3\. Ask yourself, what small, incremental steps can I take today to ensure I experience success and happiness in my life?&nbsp; For example, techniques from the&nbsp;[Happiness Trap by Russ Harris like the Expansion technique&nbsp; - making space in your mind&nbsp;](https://t.e2ma.net/click/rqpkpd/zwff20l/n77e5e){: target="_blank"}and life so that unpleasant feelings will not feel so stressful and intrusive yet will allow you to continue&nbsp;[taking small steps each day towards your goals&nbsp;](https://t.e2ma.net/click/rqpkpd/zwff20l/3z8e5e){: target="_blank"}despite setbacks.**

**Now you can start taking back control of your life and avoid becoming a&nbsp;[Zombie on autopilot](https://t.e2ma.net/click/rqpkpd/zwff20l/js9e5e){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;for the things that really matter to you.&nbsp; Take action today to move out of a life by default and toward a life of design\!**
