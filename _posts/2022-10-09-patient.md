**WORD OF THE WEEK&nbsp;[PATIENT](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/patient)&nbsp;(adj)**

**&nbsp;‚ÄúBe Patient when it seems things are not going right and may never be right again. Accept that what is yours will come to you in the right way at just the right moment... &nbsp;[Lyanla Vanzant](https://tamarakulish.com/2020/05/14/be-patient-when-it-seems-thing-are-not-going-right/)**

**Good Morning Friends,**

**Sometimes I get asked, how can you be so patient? When you are in a service-based business and things don‚Äôt go according to plan, clients and customers tend to get upset, become entrenched in their position or at times get downright irate. This is the time I realize the situation calls for a little strategic&nbsp;[patience](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/patient)&nbsp;to get through a less-than-ideal situation.**

**Easy to say if you are far removed from the circumstances, but when you find yourself right smack in the middle, what‚Äôs the best way to approach it?&nbsp; Last evening, I pulled out my sewing machine for the first time in many, MANY months as I had a few sewing repairs that were long overdue for someone I cared about (and who was also becoming a bit impatient with my promises to take care of this\!) &nbsp;As I set up and revved up my neglected machine and started the task, memories came flooding back about how I had learned as a kid, to sew under the tutelage of my Grandma Katie. She was a tough task master. I would start a project, pick a pattern for a skirt or jacket and begin my task. Periodically, she‚Äôd review what I had done and detect that I was trying to take a few shortcuts. &nbsp;I would promptly be told to ‚Äúrip it out‚Äù and start over again\!&nbsp; As time went by, I painstakingly learned how to carefully follow directions plus sew buttonholes, hems and zippers the proper way\!**

**Making mistakes and having to start over without having a ‚Äúbreakdown‚Äù are lessons in life we all have to learn. &nbsp;Becoming a patient person can be a frustrating but worthwhile experience. Learning to sew showed me that first I should start out with a plan. Second, I should endeavor not to take any shortcuts and third, if I make a mistake, I must be willing to back up and start over until I get it right. Being able to apply these kinds of life lessons from your life will, I‚Äôm sure, contribute to your having patience when it is called for in your life too\!&nbsp;**

**By the way, I got my sewing repair done, but only after I had to replace a broken sewing needle, come up with a creative solution to strategically mend a difficult hole and for those of you who know about sewing, refill my&nbsp;[bobbin](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/fixing-bobbin-thread-bunching-looping-tangling-2978069)&nbsp;thread not once but twice when it ran out\! &nbsp; PATIENCE‚Ä¶ üòä**
