***&nbsp;" Miracles start to happen when you give as much energy to your dreams as you do to your fears."&nbsp; -&nbsp;[Richard Wilkins&nbsp;](https://t.e2ma.net/click/fhqlnd/zwff20l/ralm3e){: target="_blank"}*&nbsp;**

**Good Morning\! &nbsp;**

**This week let’s focus on something that is so important in our lives. It’s free, all around us, and a force of nature so powerful it can change the course of your life. It’s&nbsp;[Positive Energy](https://t.e2ma.net/click/fhqlnd/zwff20l/nvmm3e){: target="_blank"}. While, to some, that may seem a little out there, the&nbsp;[science&nbsp;](https://t.e2ma.net/click/fhqlnd/zwff20l/3nnm3e){: target="_blank"}behind happiness, smiling, laughing, and positive energy is indisputable\! &nbsp;It’s a funny thing, you know – so often people fight for their limitations or the things that bring them stress and grief\! They lock in on the fact that they have a RIGHT to feel those things – and of course, most of the time they do.**

**Here’s the thing – we all have just as much RIGHT to fight for the good stuff. For the ability to be truly happy. For the choice to be positive. For the purpose of&nbsp;[living joyfully](https://t.e2ma.net/click/fhqlnd/zwff20l/jgom3e){: target="_blank"}. Is it always easy in our world? Nope. Not by a long shot. There are media outlets and social media posts, and new diseases and new disasters that are bent on tying people to the sky-is-falling mental state. The cool part is we get to change the channel. We get to choose our direction. We get to lean into the positive and let go of the negative. It takes some practice – but oh boy is it worth it\! This week fill your mind and schedule with the good stuff. Keep a&nbsp;[gratitude journal](https://t.e2ma.net/click/fhqlnd/zwff20l/z8om3e){: target="_blank"}. Find five things each day that light you up with positive energy. You might surprise yourself and want to keep that practice going all year\! I know I do\! Have a great week\!**

**Something to Think AboutLet’s face it, in 2022, your mind will still produce unpleasant thoughts&nbsp; alongside the positive ones. We just have to learn that sometimes we need to pay attention to them. &nbsp;We can then determine that If they are helpful, we can learn from them, but if they are not, we should just let them come and let them go. &nbsp;\*Advice given in&nbsp;[“The Happiness Trap”](https://t.e2ma.net/click/fhqlnd/zwff20l/f1pm3e){: target="_blank"}&nbsp; by Russ Harris.**
