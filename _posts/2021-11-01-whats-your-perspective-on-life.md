**Good Morning\! &nbsp;&nbsp;**

**As you go throughout your day, you might be met with challenges, changes, and opportunities. How you frame those experiences shapes your perspective about them. If you view the event as a challenge rather than a threat, you are more likely to respond with&nbsp;[resilience](https://t.e2ma.net/click/w2otbf/sbltq1c/g2hfmo){: target="_blank"}. The ability to view events as challenges develops when you practice coping skills with continued exposure to moderate adversity. These mildly painful experiences include performing strenuous exercise, learning something new, or taking on a project that might seem overwhelming in the beginning. As you intentionally go outside your comfort zone, each achievement builds confidence and coping skills to be used in the future.**
