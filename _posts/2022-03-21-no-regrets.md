***“When one door closes, another door opens; but we so often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door, that we do not see the ones which open for us.”*&nbsp;-&nbsp;[Alexander Graham Bell](https://t.e2ma.net/click/ltx0je/hmthfkv/lpaghi){: target="_blank"}**

**At one point or another, every one of us has wrestled with regret. Today we are going to talk about living life with&nbsp;[No Regrets](https://t.e2ma.net/click/ltx0je/hmthfkv/1hbghi){: target="_blank"}\! All of us wish we had approached a situation differently or taken that risk or seized on an opportunity when it presented itself, but we didn’t.**

**Alexander Graham Bell was a great example of moving forward despite what must have been some regrets.&nbsp; March marks the quick succession of two important anniversaries in the life of Alexander Graham Bell – his birthday (March 3) and the date he patented his groundbreaking telephone (March 7, 1874).&nbsp; And though we think of his invention as one that changed the course of history, success for Bell wasn’t always smooth. For instance, he was accused of stealing the idea for the telephone from Elisha Gray, who filed for a patent on the same day but Bell filed a few hours before Gray\! Then there was the controversy about his use of Antonio Meucci's work, who was determined to have been the true inventor of the "teletrofono"\!**

**In any event, due to his persistence, Bell has gone down in history as the&nbsp;[father of the telephone](https://t.e2ma.net/click/ltx0je/hmthfkv/hacghi){: target="_blank"}, and his invention historically changed how people communicated. In fact, Bell’s innovation completely disrupted the norm of communications. When he tried to sell the telephone patent to Western Union in the late-1800s, the company’s president scoffed at the idea, and thought of the telephone as only a toy. None-the-less, Alexander Graham Bell pressed on with no regrets\!**

**Despite the multitude of things Bell invented, he encountered continual challenges. Many of Bell’s other 16, non-communications-related patents are a testament to his general interest in inventive ideas. While ahead of their time, these were not as successful as the telephone.&nbsp; To read more about some of Bell’s invention ideas (that were quite unique) :&nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://t.e2ma.net/click/ltx0je/hmthfkv/x2cghi){: target="_blank"}**

**I often hear people talk about regrets they have about decisions they made many years ago or decisions they did not make. Their regret weighs on them like an anchor, and often prevents them from moving forward. Regret does not need to be something that we carry into the future, constantly replaying it back in our heads. Regret can be a barrier, or it can be a compass, helping us to make better decisions. The choice is yours with....[No Regrets\!](https://t.e2ma.net/click/ltx0je/hmthfkv/dvdghi){: target="_blank"}**
