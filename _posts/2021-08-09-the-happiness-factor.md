The Happiness Factor&nbsp;*“When I was 5 years old, my mother.. told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down ‘happy’. They told me I didn’t understand the assignment, and I told them they didn’t understand life."&nbsp;*John Lennon&nbsp;*&nbsp;*[CLICK HERE FOR MORE](https://youtu.be/vND53ZrQD9M?t=306)

**Good Morning\!**

**What creates true happiness and contentment? Some think that money brings happiness, while others believe that it’s personal success. I don’t think there is a one-size fits-all when it comes to happiness, but here are some thoughts to get you on the right path.**

* **Internal rewards work better than external rewards.**
* **Learn to have enough and to not want more.**
* **Don’t retire. Instead, find your life’s purpose.**
* **Avoid burnout by creating space to do nothing.**
* **Move past fear to do what you want.**
* **Your most important relationship is with yourself.**

**Something to Think AboutWhile you can’t always control your situation, you can control your perception of it and look for a reason to be happy each day. People who live in the Okinawa Islands have the longest, disability-free lives on Earth. Their language doesn’t have a word for “retirement.” They focus on finding their reason for waking up each day and do it every day of their life.

**Make it a great week - and remember,&nbsp; "Don't Worry - Be Happy\!"**
