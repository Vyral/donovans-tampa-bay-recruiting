When was the last time that you wrote a letter to someone special in your life? Not a typed letter, not a message on Facebook, not an email, not a text but a real letter with an envelope and a stamp that you sent to them in the mail? An actual handwritten letter that you took the time to write.&nbsp; Some say that letter writing is a lost art, which would be sad. Schools have decided that cursive is not important to future generations, but that could not be further from the truth. Letters bring joy to those who read them, and often times, letters are kept for many years.&nbsp; Did you know that today is National Letter Writing Day? Today is a day reserved for writing a letter to someone you care about, or someone who made an impact on your life. Take a few minutes and send someone a handwritten letter today. &nbsp;&nbsp;
