***"Healthy Habits are learned in the same way as unhealthy ones - through practice.******"&nbsp;*****[Wayne Dyer](https://t.e2ma.net/click/f50xqd/zwff20l/fxas6e){: target="_blank"}**

**Good Morning\! &nbsp;**

**For many people, change is tough, especially when it comes to healthy habits. But if we look at just a few simple hacks, creating new healthy habits may be a lot easier than you think\!**

**In the&nbsp;[Happiness Trap](https://t.e2ma.net/click/f50xqd/zwff20l/vpbs6e){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;by Russ Harris, we learn about&nbsp;[ACT&nbsp;](https://t.e2ma.net/click/f50xqd/zwff20l/bics6e){: target="_blank"}– Acceptance and Commitment Therapy – which helps us live and behave in ways consistent with our personal values, including developing a healthy lifestyle.**

**If you have what you believe is an unhealthy habit, realize this is probably a signal that something is off-kilter in your life and you aren’t following what you really value.**

**Below, I have provided a few "[hacks](https://t.e2ma.net/click/f50xqd/zwff20l/rads6e){: target="_blank"}" to build healthy habits to replace some of those unhealthy ones. &nbsp;Just remember the 3 R’s:**

**1\. Reminders: Write your desired Healthy Habit down on a sticky note and post it in a place you will see it throughout the day. This constant reminder will work on your sub-conscience help move you toward your true healthy values.**

**2\. Rewards: When we keep track of our behaviors throughout the day, we’ll begin noticing when we practice our new healthy habits. We can then give ourselves a pat on the back or even a more tangible reward for sticking to what we said we would do. For example, getting that new pair of shoes after you've eaten your 5 fruits and veggies each day for a week\!**

**3\. Restructuring: For example, getting rid of junk food in the kitchen and stocking the pantry with healthy stuff that is then displayed front and center.&nbsp; Likewise, if its going for a walk or going to the gym – setting our sneakers or gym bag out the night before as a reminder of what you want to do when you awake\!**

**Be creative and try out different ideas for yourself. Remember: "[Proper Preparation Prevents Poor Performance\!](https://t.e2ma.net/click/f50xqd/zwff20l/72ds6e){: target="_blank"}"&nbsp; If you keep at it, eventually you will find your sweet spot so these healthy habits become automatic and work to your advantage to bring you the healthy lifestyle you deserve\!**

**IMPORTANT HEALTH ALERT: Speaking of "Health" – I want to call your attention to a potentially Life - changing vitamin for all ladies who take Calcium\!&nbsp; I was just alerted to the fact that if you take calcium and vitamin D. Without this additional nutrient, you could be putting your health at serious risk\! Please share this information with every woman you know\! (My doctor never mentioned it to me\!) It could save their lives or the life of their mother or sister\! &nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://t.e2ma.net/click/f50xqd/zwff20l/nves6e){: target="_blank"}**
