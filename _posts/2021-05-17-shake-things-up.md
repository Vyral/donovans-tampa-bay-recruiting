**Did you know that Spring is famous for “shaking things up”? All those spring storms with high winds and lighting are shaking up the dormant trees and shrubs from their winter naps. It’s natures way of saying, “Wake up\! Enjoy the beauty of your surroundings and let others admire your beauty.” Spring is a great time for you to shake it up too\! Whether it’s cleaning out closets, taking up a new hobby, or just getting outdoors for some exercise, now is a great time (especially with less stringent mask mandates) to make some new plans for the remainder of the year. Sometimes you need to shake things up to start something new, which might be uncomfortable. But sometimes&nbsp;*that uncomfortable feeling is you trying to blossom. Let yourself grow. Be comfortable with being uncomfortable for a short time to break out of your routine.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***
