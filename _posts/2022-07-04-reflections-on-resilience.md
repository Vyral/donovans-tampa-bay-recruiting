***"Change is the law of Life. Those who look only to the past are certain to miss the future."&nbsp; &nbsp;[John F. Kennedy](https://t.e2ma.net/click/f9b1zd/zwff20l/37ikef){: target="_blank"}***

**It’s here - 4thof July, 2022 - Happy Independence Day\!&nbsp; Never in our country’s history has the connection between its citizens been challenged so much as in these past two years. I don’t know about you, but it seems as though the rate of change, as they say on Star Wars, has "gone to warp speed in a&nbsp;[nano-second](https://t.e2ma.net/click/f9b1zd/zwff20l/j0jkef){: target="_blank"}\!"**

**Change affects people differently, bringing along with it a unique flood of thoughts, strong emotions and feelings of uncertainty. In the short term, many people express their dislike for change through anger, fear, lashing out and blaming others. Yet, over time, people thankfully adapt to life-changing and stressful situations, in part thanks to&nbsp;[resilience.](https://t.e2ma.net/click/f9b1zd/zwff20l/zskkef){: target="_blank"}**

**Psychologists define resilience as the process of adapting well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats, or stress - such as family and relationship problems, serious health problems, or workplace and financial stressors. (as experienced by most of us in the recent past\!) As much as&nbsp;[resilience involves “bouncing back”](https://t.e2ma.net/click/f9b1zd/zwff20l/fllkef){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;from these difficult experiences, it can also involve profound personal growth.**

**In our forefather’s time, it’s amazing that even in the face of tremendous adversity, it took only a small handful of people to demonstrate how&nbsp; resilient human beings can be. For example: the&nbsp;[suffragettes and the civil-rights](https://t.e2ma.net/click/f9b1zd/zwff20l/vdmkef){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;workers, with very few resources at their disposal, were able to move mountains\! Today, we have access to far more wealth and privilege than they did, so there is really no excuse that we, too, can’t effect massive change.**

**For me resilience is evidenced by a certain quality in a person, a confident smile on their face a calm look in their eye, a spring in their step. It’s a sense that any problem can be tackled, that we can adapt and that in the problem, often lies the solution.&nbsp;**

**In the final analysis, there are things we can each do personally to help ensure&nbsp;[life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness](https://t.e2ma.net/click/f9b1zd/zwff20l/b6mkef){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;for ourselves and for others this 4th of July and every other day.**

**We can pray that we are able to see ourselves in those who look and think differently from us and instead of seeing an enemy, to always look for the common ground between us.**

**We don’t have to worry about changing the whole world. (a daunting task anyway..). But if we each take the time to change a small thing or help a person less fortunate in improving their life, then that’s time well spent. Here's to Resilience\! Let’s make it a great Independence Day\!**
