It has been a very busy year so far and everyone is talking about how they are feeling. Are you exhausted? The belief that taking time off will cause everything to fall apart is not only unhealthy, it’s not true. Life goes on when you slow down and take time for you. If you don’t take time off, your body eventually will put its foot down and make you slow down. Bodies do it all the time. Stress is a leading cause of cancer, heart attacks, liver failure, grouchiness and a sudden lack of breath. Aside from the health issues, taking time to do the things that inspire you, should be a priority because that's why we work so hard. So that we can enjoy life and those in our life. This is not a luxury reserved for the people who are smarter, richer, or less bogged down than you are. It’s a luxury reserved for people who take the time to figure it out and choose to design a more fulfilling and meaningful life. “Why am I so tired all the time?”&nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://t.e2ma.net/click/zkqzrc/zwff20l/33b8ke){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;for more\! &nbsp;

*Laughter and tears are both responses to frustration and exhaustion. I myself prefer to laugh, since there is less cleaning up to do afterward. - Kurt Vonnergut*
