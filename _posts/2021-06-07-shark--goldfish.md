**As we begin a new month, we want to focus on ways to thrive during waves of change. During changing times, it is easy to worry or let fear have power. However, you have more control than you think.**

**How you handle adversity is your choice—the only choice that matters. Many successful people and businesses have thrived during the worst recessions and downturns. They shared similar characteristics and took similar actions to &nbsp;excel while others merely tried to survive. You can do the same.**

**In the book, "The Shark and the Goldfish", best-selling author Jon Gordon shares an inspiring fable about a goldfish named Gordy who has always been fed and taken care of in a goldfish bowl. One day, he is accidentally washed out to sea, but fortunately he meets up with an unlikely mentor – a shark\! &nbsp;Sammy the shark teaches the goldfish not only how to find food but how his attitudes about life can change by changing his thinking so that he not only survives but thrives in adverse circumstances\! &nbsp;**

**Like Gordy, we can’t control the events in our life, but we can control how we respond to them. You can allow the waves of change to stop you, or you can learn to ride them to a successful future.&nbsp; "The Shark and The Goldfish" is an impactful short story chocked full of life changing insights and tips for how to deal with uncertainty\!&nbsp; Check out an excerpt read by the author himself.&nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://t.e2ma.net/click/wqv6oe/sbltq1c/crqvmn){: target="_blank"}.&nbsp; (If you love it, head over to Audible books and get the whole book FREE with the 30 day trial\! &nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://t.e2ma.net/click/wqv6oe/sbltq1c/sjrvmn){: target="_blank"}**
