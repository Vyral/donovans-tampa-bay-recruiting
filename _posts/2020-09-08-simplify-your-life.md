In these times of great change - it's never a bad idea to slow things down and think about simplifying life.&nbsp;[**Check Out our Music Inspiration Video clip of "Banjo Joe" testing out an 1890's antique Banjo\!**](https://t.e2ma.net/click/9vvjzc/5wd3tzj/d7uppg){: target="_blank"}

Can you just imagine for a moment how simple life was back in the 1890's?&nbsp; Wouldn't it be good once in a while to unplug from the internet, cell phones and technology that often frustrates the heck out of us and sometimes kills an entire day when something goes wrong?\!\!\!

Here are four great ways to take it down a notch (and hopefully life’s stress level as well\!)

1. Slow down. Seems counter to the calendar, doesn’t it? Yes, and no. Sometimes when we stop to clarify what’s important, rid our schedules of what isn’t – it makes space for a slower pace, and a lot more mindful living.
2. Limit negativity. Let’s face it – our world is FILLED with toxic news, and negative influences. That’s bad for us in every conceivable way. It keeps us from realizing our potential, roots us in fear, and creates stress. Create significant boundaries in your life to disconnect from negative people, media, and energy. You won’t miss it\!
3. Disconnect\! Taking a time-out in your daily routine to disconnect and quiet the chaos is good for your mind, your soul, and believe it or not, your productivity. Even if it’s just 15 minutes of YOU time a day. It makes a difference.
4. Put play back in your days. That old adage of all work and no play thing is real stuff. Create some time in your daily calendar to laugh. To have fun. To play. On your own, or with a loved one. You’ll find yourself loving life a lot more when you do.

**Tip of the Week - Simplify\!**

In her book,&nbsp;[**Spark Joy: an illustrated master class in the art of organizing and tidying up**’](https://t.e2ma.net/click/9vvjzc/5wd3tzj/tzvppg){: target="_blank"}, Marie Kondo encourages people to discard the things that don’t spark joy. Unfortunately, many of us are actually weighed down by possessions and therefore not really aware, or perhaps cannot see the things that can bring joy into our lives. It is not difficult at all though to identify the objects and things that bring you joy. The moment you touch something valuable to you, you will know its importance straight away.
