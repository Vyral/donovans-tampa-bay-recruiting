Knowing what to do when you spot a stroke is critical—the right knowledge could save a life.

I wanted to do something a little different for today’s episode of "Keeping in Tune With the Market." Today, I want to talk about a very serious subject: strokes.

 Imagine you’re with family over the holiday season when suddenly you notice a loved one's face beginning to droop on one side—one side of their body appears weak and they’re now slurring their speech.

 What do you do? First, it’s time to call 911. These warning signs should never be ignored.

 Two weeks ago when my own mother began exhibiting these symptoms, my sisters were thankfully able to recognize the signs and get her immediate medical treatment.

 It is critical that people who have had or are having a stroke receive medical attention within the first three hours.

 Unfortunately, I have first-hand experience where another family member was not so fortunate. My sister-in-law had a stroke around the same time as my mother. She was out of the town at the time and went to a walk-in clinic where they told her it was probably just her back.

They sent her home and she suffered a massive stroke. As a result of not receiving prompt and immediate attention, her injuries will be long-term, if not permanent.

You may be wondering why I’ve chosen to talk about this when my usual subjects relate to real estate. The truth is that real estate is about family and home. That’s why today I chose to share this information with you—to protect your family.

The easiest way to spot and handle a stroke is to remember “F.A.S.T.,” which stands for face drooping, arm weakness, speech difficulty, and time to call 911.

Whether it is you or a family member experiencing these symptoms, do not wait. Getting immediate emergency medical treatment is absolutely key.

I hope you and your family stay happy, healthy, and able to enjoy your home.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
