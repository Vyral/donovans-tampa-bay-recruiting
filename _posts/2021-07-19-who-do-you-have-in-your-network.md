Who Do You Have in YOUR Network?&nbsp;*Trust is the value of life. It's the most essential ingredient in effective communication. It's the foundational principle that holds all relationships.”*&nbsp;Stephen Covey&nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://youtu.be/gPdgSZAUgjE)

**Good Morning\!**

**Having the right people to call when you need them provides peace of mind, right? When someone in your family is sick, you’ve usually got a doctor’s number handy. If there’s a legal question, you know an attorney to call. What about for your home? For homeowners, there seems like there is ALWAYS someone who needs to be called such as a repairman, an electrician, a plumber, pool service, roofer and the list goes on and on\!&nbsp; That’s when you need a reliable, trusted resource. As a long standing real estate resource in our community, those are the kind of contacts and relationships that I am always cultivating. Why? Because when a valued customer, colleague, neighbor or friend needs to connect with a trusted professional, I would love to be a resource they can trust\!

**If you ever have a question related to home care, repairs, insurance or even a legal matter and need a reliable reference – or you have a real estate question or need help in general that you just don’t seem to be able to find the answer to - I hope you’ll call on me\! Even if I don’t have the answer – I’ll be happy to try to find it for you\! Likewise, if you have a great resource person that you’d like to share with the rest of the community – please shoot me a quick email with their name and what they do and why you are a&nbsp;****raving fan\!&nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://contacts.byreferralonly.com/Form.aspx?Key=FEC0EE8BC3A55E330B1525DA544C1F90)**
