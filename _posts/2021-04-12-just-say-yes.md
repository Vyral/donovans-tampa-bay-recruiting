**When change is thrust upon you - do you fight it and just say "No"? Or do you look at it as a new, possible opportunity and just say "Yes?**

**In her book "The Psychology of Regret", Melanie Greenberg tells us that "NO" people regret all the times they said yes and failed while "YES" people don't regret failure, they feel regret mostly over opportunities they did not seize\!&nbsp;**

**Especially during these rapidly changing times,&nbsp; consider seizing the opportunities that present themselves. Will it be awkward at first? Probably, but t****he world will always offer us more of what we think about the most. That whole, “change your thoughts and you change your world” thing is real. Change your self-talk to positive affirmations that will help you try new things, new experiences, even new relationships and friendships on for size\! Just Say YES\!
