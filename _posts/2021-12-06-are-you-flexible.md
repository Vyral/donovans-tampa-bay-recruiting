Click on link to listen : "Bend Me Shape Me" \*\*- by American Breed&nbsp;*[CLICK HERE&nbsp;](https://t.e2ma.net/click/rij2kd/zwff20l/f5we1e){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;&nbsp;*****or "Roll With It\*\*"- by Steve Winwood&nbsp;*[CLICK HERE](https://t.e2ma.net/click/rij2kd/zwff20l/vxxe1e){: target="_blank"}**

**Good Morning\! &nbsp;**

**Are you flexible? I’m not necessarily talking about being to do a back bend or assume some&nbsp;[pretzel-like yoga pose](https://t.e2ma.net/click/rij2kd/zwff20l/bqye1e){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;(though that would be awesome to see you do this\!)**

**&nbsp;I am talking about being able to ‘roll with the punches’ and ‘ride the wave’ as inevitable adversity comes our way. … I’m referring to&nbsp;[psychological flexibility.](https://t.e2ma.net/click/rij2kd/zwff20l/rize1e){: target="_blank"}**

**When problems, stress and disappointment come your way, how do you react to it, how do you cope?**

**I’m sure you’ve heard incredible stories of bravery, persistence and ingenuity that have been displayed by amazing people like; Helen Keller, Nelson Mandela, Viktor Frankl and Mother Theresa, to name a few.&nbsp;**

**There are 6 basic principles when dealing with adversity that I am willing to bet&nbsp; our role models followed.&nbsp; They are:**

1. **Defusion&nbsp;**
2. **Expansion**
3. **Connection&nbsp;**
4. **Observing Self&nbsp;**
5. **Values&nbsp;**
6. **Committed Action**

**In future weeks, we'll be looking at these principles one at a time to see how they can help us improve our "psychological flexibility" when inevitable stress comes our way. By using these strategies, we will gain awareness, openness and focus to take effective action.&nbsp; We may even discover that we can enjoy a rich, full and meaningful life with less stress and more fun\!&nbsp;**
