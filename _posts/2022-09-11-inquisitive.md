**INSPIRATION FOR YOUR WEEK AHEAD:**

**WORD OF THE WEEK&nbsp;[INQUISITIVE](https://vocabulary-vocabulary.com/dictionary/inquisitive.php)**

**&nbsp;‚ÄúChildren astound me with their inquisitive minds. The world is wide and mysterious to them and as they piece together the puzzle of life, they ask "why?" ceaselessly.&nbsp;****.[John C. Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Maxwell)**

**Good Morning Friends,**

**I‚Äôm sure as a child, you heard such expressions as ‚Äúcuriosity killed the cat‚Äù or ‚Äúit is better to be seen and not heard‚Äù. &nbsp;As we grew up, many of us were taught not to ask questions, not to be curious about things, not to be ‚ÄúInquisitive‚Äù\!&nbsp;**

**In adult life, that‚Äôs why it is difficult for many of us to ask questions when we don‚Äôt know something or when we want to find out more about a particular topic. &nbsp;We either feel like we are being impolite or rude for asking a question, or we feel like we look stupid\! We are damned if we do and damned if we don‚Äôt\! &nbsp;**

**Do you have a high CQ? (Curiosity Quotient) find out&nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://www.ootsuk.com/myCQ).**

**If you didn‚Äôt score particularly high or when it comes to asking questions, your palms get sweaty and your heart starts racing, we can learn a lesson from a funny little storybook character named Curious George. I think George can show us 3 easy things to do in order to&nbsp;[chill](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Chill)&nbsp;and become our best, most productive, inquisitive self:**

**1\. Remember, it‚Äôs OK to be inquisitive\!&nbsp; Having that sense of wonder and curiosity will allow you to discover new things and set yourself apart from the crowd.**

**2\. Curious George shows us that its OK to make mistakes. The world will not come to an end because you made a mistake\!&nbsp; This is part of the learning process and this is how we practice and perfect the way we react to events that happen to us in this thing we call ‚ÄúLife‚Äù.**

**3\. No matter what happens, good or bad, you can still have a great attitude. When Curious George makes a mistake, he acknowledges it, makes amends if needed and moves on with a positive outlook never rethinking or agonizing about what happened\!**

**Here‚Äôs wishing you a curiosity filled week in your quest for your own answers to whatever is on your mind, and even if you make mistakes and have a few false starts, may you end up in a happy place with an attitude of gratitude\!**
