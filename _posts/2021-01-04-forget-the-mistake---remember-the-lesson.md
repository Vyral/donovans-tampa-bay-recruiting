As we head into the fresh, new year, I found this excerpt from author Neil Gaiman that I thought was meaningful and a great way to keep perspective this new year. Here is what Neil's wish is for you in this coming year\!

“I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes. Because if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things happen, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, and changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. &nbsp;So that's my wish for you, and all of us...&nbsp; &nbsp;Make new mistakes. Make glorious, amazing mistakes. Make mistakes nobody's ever made before. Don't freeze, don't stop, don't worry that it isn't good enough, or it isn't perfect, whatever it is: art, love, work, family or life. Whatever it is you're scared of doing, Do it. Make your mistakes, this year, next year, and forever.”

We learned a lot from the last year - about making mistakes and learning from them and moving forward. About adapting to change. This year, let's embrace our resilience and ability to adapt and overcome and truly take on every day as it comes - learning and remembering the valuable lessons while putting the past behind us\! &nbsp;[**CLICK HERE**](https://t.e2ma.net/click/1p5oad/5wd3tzj/tfws0g){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;to find out more about&nbsp;**12 things you should tell yourself after you've screwed up\!**

**Words of Wisdom**

*You're only here for a short visit. Don't hurry, don't worry. And be sure to smell the flowers along the way.&nbsp; &nbsp;Walter Hagen*

*I think my mother... made it clear that you have to live life by your own terms and you have to not worry about what other people think and you have to have the courage to do the unexpected.&nbsp; &nbsp;Caroline Kennedy*

*When you begin to worry, go find something to do. Get busy being a blessing to someone; do something fruitful. Talking about your problem or sitting alone, thinking about it, does no good; it serves only to make you miserable. Above all else, remember that worrying is totally useless. Worrying will not solve your problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;Joyce Meyer*

*Worry never robs tomorrow of its sorrow, it only saps today of its joy. Leo Buscaglia&nbsp;*
