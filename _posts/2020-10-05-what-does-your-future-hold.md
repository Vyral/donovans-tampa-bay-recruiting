This has been a very unusual week to say the least. No one could have predicted the circumstances that our country, our president or each of us as individuals find ourselves in. (Sometimes it would be great to have a crystal ball so we could at least have a clue\!)&nbsp; How you move forward when you find yourself in an adverse situation is up to you. This year we have learned how to pivot on a dime. We've learned to work from home, tap into our creative side, leaned into technology, learned to home school our kids and for many, deal with tremendous loss and stress\!&nbsp;

What’s next for you? Will you continue on the path that you were on or has this year presented some opportunities for you to pursue? Though there are many things in life we can't control - such as a pandemic or a stock market crash, there are things we can do to navigate the course of our lives. Reshaping your future is possible when you have a clear vision of what you want and action steps to achieve that life. The first step is to know what you want and why. Are you willing to do what is needed to achieve that goal? As you begin to formulate your plan, you will see the shape of your vision take form and that’s when you know that you are well on your way to achieving that dream.

**Words of Wisdom**

Be brave enough to live the life of your dreams according to your vision and purpose instead of the expectations and opinions of others. -&nbsp;**Roy T. Bennett**

A leader has the vision and conviction that a dream can be achieved. He inspires the power and energy to get it done.&nbsp;**– Ralph Lauren**

The empires of the future are empires of the mind.&nbsp;**– Winston Churchill**

Dream lofty dreams, and as you dream, so shall you become. Your Vision is the promise of what you shall one day be. Your Ideal is the prophecy of what you shall at last unveil.&nbsp;**– James Allen**

The only thing worse than not having sight is having sight but no vision. -&nbsp;**Helen Keller**
