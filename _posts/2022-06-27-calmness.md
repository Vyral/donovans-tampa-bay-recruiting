***"Calmness of mind is one of the beautiful jewels of wisdom" &nbsp;[James Allen](https://t.e2ma.net/click/jcpkzd/jw4ppix/33n9df){: target="_blank"}***

&nbsp;**A person who is truly wise will also be a person who displays calmness in the midst of stress and hardships. A wise person realizes that if they allow themselves to lose control of their emotions, then they will make foolish decisions, take foolish actions, and say foolish and hurtful words to others, including those that they love (not to mention those they didn't like very much to begin with\!)&nbsp;**

**A wise person will[&nbsp;not allow external circumstances to control their mind](https://t.e2ma.net/click/jcpkzd/jw4ppix/jwo9df){: target="_blank"}, which in turn, controls their actions. A wise person who makes it a point to remain calm in every situation as much as he can is certainly a beautiful treasure in a world filled with hate and violence.**

**But the elephant in the room remains... How do we stay calm in the face of such strife and anger in today’s world? ?**

[James Allen recommends that as we try to understand ourselves&nbsp;](https://t.e2ma.net/click/jcpkzd/jw4ppix/zop9df){: target="_blank"}**and to understand others, our mind becomes calmer as we realize the relationship of cause and effect. In other words, the more we cease to fret, fume and worry, the calmer we become. &nbsp;The calmer we become, the calmer people around us become.&nbsp; As James Allen said, "The more tranquil a man becomes, the greater is his success, his influence, his power for good".**

**Take some time this week, take a deep breath, and make a conscious effort to understand someone whose viewpoint is really irritating you. &nbsp;As calmness washes over you – it may just rub off on others\! I know it won't be easy at first, but give it a try and see what happens.&nbsp; Make it a great week\!**
