**Good Morning\!&nbsp;**

**What is the True Meaning of Happiness? Everyone would like to be happy. &nbsp;We have talked about this topic before in our Monday Morning Wake Up blog, but what really is the true meaning of happiness? Is it “Feeling Good” via pleasure, gladness and gratification?&nbsp; Or is it “Living a meaningful Life” by taking action on things that truly matter to us and are valuable and worthy?I have recently started reading a really interesting book called&nbsp;[“The Happiness Trap” How to Stop Struggling and Start Living&nbsp;](https://t.e2ma.net/click/3nb1id/zwff20l/j0zsze){: target="_blank"}[by Russ Harris.](https://t.e2ma.net/click/3nb1id/zwff20l/zs0sze){: target="_blank"}&nbsp; In this book, the topic of true happiness is described as living a full, rich and meaningful life, rather than merely the short-term reward of seeking out “good feelings”.The author also goes on to talk about the inevitable pain, disappointment and sadness that come to all of us… but that we can learn to handle it and “roll with the punches” in order to create a life worth living despite it. In upcoming weeks, I look forward to sharing my findings and observations with you about being truly happy.&nbsp; If you’d like to join me the quest – here’s the link for the book online:&nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://t.e2ma.net/click/3nb1id/zwff20l/fl1sze){: target="_blank"}**
