There’s no doubt that 2020 has stirred up more emotions and more fear than most have ever seen in their lifetime. &nbsp;When you are in a fearful state you are more cautious and sometimes pass up opportunities that could open up an entire world to you. When you are in a state of fear you also second-guess your own decisions. Fear is one of the most powerful emotions that we possess. It’s real and it affects all of us at one time or another. But it’s also a necessary emotion for change or risk. Some people will choose to stay in the safe zone and select the predictable outcome while others will take the risk in search of something new and better. &nbsp;What will you choose as we head into the last quarter of this year?

**Something to Think About**

No one can predict the future or guarantee the outcome of a decision. There is one guarantee - at some point you will make a less than perfect decision. But guess what? You'll be OK, even if you aren't experiencing your perfect world (which as we all know does not exist anyway\!)&nbsp; So, relax. Make a decision. Don't let fear paralyze you.

When my husband was a young boy and up to bat playing baseball he became frustrated because he was always striking out. Then one day, his dad helped him to make a decision that when he was up to bat he would always swing on pitches 1 and 3 no matter what. After that, he was always able to get a hit and make it to first base\! When faced with a tough decision, we should always ask ourselves this question. What’s the worst that can happen? Can I live with that outcome? If so, move forward.

**Weekly Activity**

What has been your greatest fear this year?&nbsp; I really like what Dave Ramsey said about making a decision: "I make my decision. Then if things don't turn out like I thought, I make another decision."&nbsp; Just remember, not making a decision IS making a decision anyway\!
