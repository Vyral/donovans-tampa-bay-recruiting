**WORD OF THE WEEK&nbsp;[REFLECTION](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reflection)**

**Good Morning Friends,**

**&nbsp;Happy New Year\! As you think back about 2022, are you glad it’s over? &nbsp;Are you looking forward to making some changes? If so, here is a quote that might point you in the right direction: “We don’t learn by doing, we learn by reflecting on what we’ve done.” &nbsp;I often hear people talk about New Years resolutions. They are ready to jump right in and change all the things they are dissatisfied about. &nbsp; For example, they want to: lose weight, stop smoking, get exercise or eliminate whatever flaw they think they have.**

**For 2023, though, instead of being “all speed and no control” and just jumping into a New Year’s resolution that you probably won’t keep anyway. Why not take a breath and jot down and then reflect on your past year’s accomplishments instead?**

**Simply take out a piece of paper and a pen and write down a win (no matter how small) for each of the 5 “F’s” in your life:&nbsp; Faith, Fun, Family, Financial and “F” physical\! I bet when you look at what you wrote, you will be amazed at some of last year’s wins that you can now focus and improve on to make 2023 an even better year\!&nbsp; As Wayne Dyer said: “When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change\!”**
