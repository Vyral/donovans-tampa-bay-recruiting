**Imagine life as a game in which you are juggling five balls in the air. You name them – work, family, health, friends, and spirit and your job is to keep them all in motion. If you drop one of these balls – what will bounce back? Work is the rubber ball that bounces back. We are seeing that each day as the country reopens. Businesses are reporting increased sales and real estate is quickly rebounding all across the world. But not all these balls are so quick to bounce back. If you drop spirit, it does not bounce back so quickly and can affect every other ball that you are attempting to juggle. The health ball is one that we have discovered is very fragile, so carefully protect it. If you drop the family and friends balls, they will be irrevocably scuffed, marked, nicked, damaged, or even shattered. They will never be the same. Relationships need care, time, nurturing and attention.**

As you strive for balance in your life cherish and handle your relationships and your health with care. Surround yourself with those who feed your spirit and keep it in the air, and embrace your work, because it keeps everything else in balance.

**Something to Think About**Life is a juggling act, and it takes focus to keep all those balls in the air at the same time. It also has no limitations except the ones you make.

**Weekly Activity**Take an hour this week to outline all the different areas of your life and see which might need some TLC right now. You’ve got this\!

**Words of Wisdom***Balance is not better time management, but better boundary management. Balance means making choices and enjoy those choices. – Betsy Jacobson*
