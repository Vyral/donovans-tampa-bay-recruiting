I love this Audrey Hepburn quote, “The best thing to hold onto in life is each other.” Time and again, we are reminded of how very short and precious life is. The time to show love to those who matter most is here and now. While the romance of the season is wonderful, let’s not stop at our spouse or significant other this year – let’s reach out to all of the folks who make getting up in the morning worthwhile… the ones who make us laugh out loud… the ones who make us proud on a regular basis… the ones who make life unforgettable.&nbsp; Let’s go make some memories with those folks, even if you still have to do that virtually\! Reach out to those who are far away with a fun trip down memory lane as well. We’ll never look at February the same way again if we do\! &nbsp;

**Words of Wisdom&nbsp;**

*"The most beautiful things are not associated with money: they are memories and moments. if you don't celebrate those, they can pass you by." - Alek Wek*

*"One of the best ways to make yourself happy in the present is to recall happy times from the past. Photos are a great memory-prompt, and because we tend to take photos of happy occasions, they weight our memories to the good."&nbsp; Gretchen Rubin*
