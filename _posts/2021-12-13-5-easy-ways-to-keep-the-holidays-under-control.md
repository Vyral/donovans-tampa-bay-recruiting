**Good Morning\! &nbsp;**

**Here's an interesting fact.&nbsp; Did you know that the word "control" can be used as both a noun and a verb? In the dictionary, "Control" as a noun is defined as the acto of controlling something or someone, or the power to do so. For example: "The teacher doesn't have any control over her class."**

**As a verb, “control” is defined as: to order, limit or rule something, or someone’s actions or behavior as in this example: “The temperature is controlled by a thermostat”.**

**However you slice it, as a noun or a verb, you want to be in control of your&nbsp;[Holiday Celebrations](https://t.e2ma.net/click/8r4vjf/sbltq1c/8zq6wo){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;and control how they turn out – right?**

**Here are 5 easy ways to keep the Holidays under control:&nbsp;**

**If the holidays are a time of stress for you, or if the holiday time makes you wish you could wake up when it’s all over, here are some easy tips to make your Holidays peaceful and serene.**

**First, are your expectations realistic? What gets people upset is not what actually happens, but having their expectations dashed. If you want everything to be perfect, with the dinner preparations going smoothly and everyone behaving perfectly, then you are probably setting yourself up for disappointment. Lighten up and go with the flow. Take a step back and&nbsp;[relax](https://t.e2ma.net/click/8r4vjf/sbltq1c/kdt6wo){: target="_blank"}. When family or friends get on your nerves, let it go and just realize that's human nature. Maybe you don’t need to take control.**

**&nbsp;If get-togethers and gift giving seem stressful, maybe you need to pare down your guest list or limit the number of gifts you give. The holidays are a special time to together (in whatever fashion is safe during the pandemic). There's no need to overdo it. Spend time instead, with a small family group or share time over face-time if you can't be together in person\!**

**&nbsp;Give yourself permission to not have perfection. The house need not have every light hung perfectly in order for the holiday to be beautiful and special. Would your kids and your friends and family rather have your attention or have everything be perfect about your holiday decor?**

**Remember what the holidays are really about: Family togetherness, spiritual enlightenment and&nbsp;[camaraderie](https://t.e2ma.net/click/8r4vjf/sbltq1c/gyu6wo){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;with friends.**

**Last but not least, if you are alone for the holidays, give to others. Consider those less fortunate. Fill your heart up by helping others and the blessings will come back to you.**

It's that you need to love something that much so you can never be controlled..." -&nbsp;[Patrick Ness](https://t.e2ma.net/click/8r4vjf/sbltq1c/83x6wo){: target="_blank"}[&nbsp;](https://t.e2ma.net/click/8r4vjf/sbltq1c/4oz6wo){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;&nbsp;**
