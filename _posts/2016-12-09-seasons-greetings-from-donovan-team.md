It may surprise some of you to know that we at the Donovan Team are as passionate about music as we are about real estate! Please check out this year's Singing Christmas Card!

With the holidays in full swing, we wanted to share something special with you today.

 As many of you may know from prior posts - when we aren’t busy helping our clients buy and sell real estate or helping our team members design their dream real estate career,  we love writing and performing music!

We are proud to present our 5th Annual Singing Christmas card for your musical entertainment! This year's presentation is entitled: “Memories Are Evergreen”. With guest vocalist Paul Donovan on lead, Joe Donovan, musical producer on harmonica, and Karen Donovan, singer/song writer, on backup vocals. Warning - this video could bring a tear to your eye as you recall happy memories from your past!

 <a href="https://youtu.be/mU4yjm5AOCc" target="_blank">Click here</a> to hear the track and see the music video, which is comprised of our home movies from years ago. You may even recognize a few members of the Donovan Brothers Realty team in it!

From all of us at the Donovan Team, we’d like to wish  all of our Clients, Friends, Colleagues & Loved ones a Blessed Holiday and Happy and Healthy New Year and may all your wishes come true!

In the meantime, if we can help you or a Real Estate Colleague you care about with Real Estate endevors 2017 - don't hesitate to give us a call!
