***" The difference between what you were yesterday and what you will be tomorrow, is what you do today."&nbsp; -&nbsp;[Stephen Pierce&nbsp;](https://t.e2ma.net/click/owerrf/sbltq1c/klz45o){: target="_blank"}*&nbsp;**

**Good Morning\! &nbsp;**

**One of the toughest things for most people is managing their emotions and actions that revolve around things that are&nbsp;[outside their control.](https://t.e2ma.net/click/owerrf/sbltq1c/g6045o){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;It’s frustrating and scary for most of us, enough so that it is a frontrunner in the cause of stress in people today. We can’t control the traffic, the weather, or what other people say, think or do. Yet, we are SO wrapped up in trying\!**

**The question of the hour is: Do our emotions always control our behavior? The answer is quite simply, no\!&nbsp; For example, consider&nbsp;[meeting a bear while on a hike](https://t.e2ma.net/click/owerrf/sbltq1c/wy145o){: target="_blank"}. Inside you may feel terrified and want to make a quick get-away.&nbsp; But instead, you control that urge and stand perfectly still so as not to trigger the bear’s pursuit instinct\! There are times in your life where we yell at people, throw things or engage in any number of destructive behaviors, but we just have to realize that no matter how intense our emotions are, we can still control our actions\!**

**Weekly Challenge: Make a list of three things that have been weighing on you that you actually have no control over and make a conscious effort to replace how you react to that thing with a&nbsp;[positive action instead of an angry, negative or fearful action](https://t.e2ma.net/click/owerrf/sbltq1c/cr245o){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;(Like when someone cuts you off in traffic – smile and say “have a good day” instead of what you were going to say\!)**

**"The task is not to control the wind, but to direct the movements of the ship so that it stays on course." -&nbsp;[Jessica & Michael Hinz](https://t.e2ma.net/click/owerrf/sbltq1c/8b445o){: target="_blank"}**

**Make it a Great Week\!**
