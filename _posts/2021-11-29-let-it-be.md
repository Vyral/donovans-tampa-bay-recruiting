Click on link to listen : "Let it Go" \*\*- by Tim McGraw&nbsp;*[CLICK HERE&nbsp;](https://t.e2ma.net/click/ftvlkd/zwff20l/fp4x0e){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;&nbsp;*****or "Don't Look Back\*\*"- by Boston\*\*&nbsp;*&nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://t.e2ma.net/click/ftvlkd/zwff20l/vh5x0e){: target="_blank"}**

**Good Morning\! &nbsp;**

**Do I control my thoughts or do my thoughts control me? In our day to day lives, we have so many experiences. Some inevitably pop up that are unpleasant.**

**It may be something from our past; the thought of which seems to come up repeatedly, like the&nbsp;[beach ball](https://t.e2ma.net/click/ftvlkd/zwff20l/ba6x0e){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;you try to hold down&nbsp;[underwater,](https://t.e2ma.net/click/ftvlkd/zwff20l/r26x0e){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;until eventually your arm gets tired and then it just pops up again.**

**These experiences may come in the form of strife or aggravation with a coworker, boss, spouse, parent, child or a neighbor.**

**What is the best strategy for dealing with these unpleasant thoughts and experiences?&nbsp;**

**Do we ignore them? Do we try to control them? … Probably neither\!**

**Instead, we can take a deep breath and realize that the best way to manage negative thoughts and feelings is by acknowledging their presence and then just “Letting them be” without having to analyze or judge them. With this simple strategy, we can learn to live effective and truly happy lives in spite of adversity and strife. This way,&nbsp; we not only survive but we thrive\! Just follow the words of wisdom: "Let it be\!"&nbsp;**
