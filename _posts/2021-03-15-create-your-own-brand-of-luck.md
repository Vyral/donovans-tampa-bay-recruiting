You do not need shamrocks or lucky charms for luck – just a shift in mindset and motivation\!&nbsp; The old saying, “where your focus goes, energy flows,” is real. When we stop looking for luck and actually start focusing on bringing the things we want most into our lives, that’s when true “luck” kicks into gear\! What are two ways to start feeling "luckier"? First, start looking for 3 blessings you can count every day and keep them in a journal. (This is a great activity for&nbsp; kids as well.)

We can choose to see what goes right or wrong. When you are actively looking for things that went right that you can write down each day, it changes how you look at life\!&nbsp; Next, help others as often as possible. It’s the kind of thing that lifts not just their spirits, but yours as well. Wishing you a week filled with joy and laughter – and the brand of luck that is tailor made just for you\!
