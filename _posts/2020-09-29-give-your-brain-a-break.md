Did you know that a part of each day should include some down time for your brain to rest? Practically speaking, that means turning off Netflix during dinner, strolling at lunch without ear buds or riding the train or preparing for bed without watching your phone.

It is hard to disconnect in a world that has us connected to technology 24/7. “Smart” phones may be smart but it’s not smart to stay connected all the time. They constantly stimulate, but, research shows, they can overstimulate if not kept in their place. “Bring back boredom,” says Dr. Michael Rich, director for the Center for Media and Child Health in Boston. “Downtime is to the brain what sleep is to the body.”

But, you say frantically, "I have too much to do and so little time\!" What if I told you, it only takes 10 Mindful Minutes to give your Brain a Break? Take 10 minutes and check out this cool TED talk by Andy Puddicome&nbsp;[**HERE**](https://t.e2ma.net/click/7yyh9b/zwff20l/v57b8d){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;on how to put just 10 minutes to very productive use to give your brain a break\!

**Make Your Bedroom a Restful Place**

Most rooms in your house or apartment are designed for work, entertainment or busy preparation for getting ready to be "on the go". Your bedroom, however, should be designed to bring you calm and comfort so that your brain get some relief from the daily grind\! Here are some great tips on&nbsp;[**How to Create a Relaxing Bedroom**](https://t.e2ma.net/click/7yyh9b/zwff20l/by8b8d){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;- check it out\!

**Something to Think About**

If you get in the habit of giving your brain downtime, permission to be silent, new ideas and creativity will root and bloom.

**Weekly Activity**

Be intentional about downtime for your brain this week. Also be mindful of your nightly sleep cycle. A great app I have used for over a year now, recommended by coach Joe Stumpf is:&nbsp;**Sleep Cycle app**. Check out the app below\!&nbsp; It helps you to keep track of how many hours of sleep you get. (minimum of 7 hours recommended) but also the Quality of your sleep and even how much you snore\! - Who me?&nbsp;*I DON'T SNORE\!&nbsp;*To check out the app go to:&nbsp;[**Androids Here**](https://t.e2ma.net/click/7yyh9b/zwff20l/rq9b8d){: target="_blank"}&nbsp; &nbsp;[**IPhones Here**](https://t.e2ma.net/click/7yyh9b/zwff20l/7iac8d){: target="_blank"}

**Words of Wisdom**

Think of a wave: it washes onto the shore, and then it rolls back. Likewise, each of your activities has a backside of stillness. To be with people, you must be alone. To listen, you need silence. To exercise, you need rest. You do not need to inflict rest, silence, or aloneness. You can simply surrender to your existing urges for these essential actions. -&nbsp;**Vironika Tugaleva**

If you wish to be refreshed, rest. - &nbsp;**Lailah Gifty Akita**

Do your best and take your rest. He who fights and recharges is poised to discharge his opponent. - &nbsp;**Vincent Okay Nwachukwu**

We need quiet time to examine our lives openly and honestly - spending quiet time alone gives your mind an opportunity to renew itself and create order. -&nbsp;**Susan L. Taylor**

Solitude is very different from a 'time-out' from our busy lives. Solitude is the very ground from which community grows. Whenever we pray alone, study, read, write, or simply spend quiet time away from the places where we interact with each other directly, we are potentially opened for a deeper intimacy with each other. -&nbsp;**Henri Nouwen**

Make it a&nbsp;**Great Week and Don't forget to give your brain a break\!**
