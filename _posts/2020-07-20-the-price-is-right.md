Markets are shifting. Some may tell you that if you are selling a home, you can put whatever price you’d like on it and it will sell. Even in a seller's market - that's not always the case. I have many homeowners calling me now to discuss how to get the best possible price for their home. My advice is to price it at or just below market value. When you do, it catapults your listing to the top of the “gotta see” list. When that happens, we’ll actually see multiple offers which allows you to negotiate up rather than down. So, how much is your house worth? Let’s get together and take a look at your home, the upgrades & updates you’ve made, and the comparable homes that have sold in the area. That will give us the fair market value, which is always the perfect place to start. For a quick snapshot of your neighborhood home prices&nbsp;**(put your automated CMA link here)**

Buyers are out in force and inventory is historically low. Because of the health crisis - much of that "spring market" activity is actually happening right now - so things are HOT. If you've thought about moving up to your next level home - or just finding a better fit for your family during these uncertain times - now is the time\! We're seeing multiple offers on many listings meaning a higher return for sellers\!

If you are considering buying a home, don’t obsess over trying to time the market to get the best price; it’s all but impossible to do. The best time to buy is when you find the perfect house, and you can afford it. Real estate is cyclical – it goes up and down and back up again. If you wait for the perfect time to buy, you’re probably going to miss out.
