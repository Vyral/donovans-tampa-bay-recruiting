I hope you had a nice relaxing weekend. Last week we talked about dreams. Creating our dream life, pursuing new opportunities, and all that sounds exciting, but sometimes change can be scary. Change can come in many forms throughout our lives.

It might come forcefully like a tidal wave, as we saw in 2020, or creep along incrementally like a glacier. It might come in the form of devastating tragedy, difficult choices, broken relationships but it could also come as new opportunities.

Even though change can be difficult, many times we find later on that it was for the best. Accomplishing anything great in life requires us to make difficult choices that push us beyond our comfort zones. That might mean broadening your circle of friends while leaving some behind, making a change from a mediocre job to something more fulfilling or moving from a comfortable house that no longer suits your needs, or anything else thatâ€™s holding you back from accomplishing your dreams at this stage of your life.

Of course, change is often difficult and painful. But whatever kind of change you are dealing with, know that you will learn to cope, and that you have a unique opportunity to shape your future. Here is a great 3 minute clip with Opra Winfrey about how to deal with Change -&nbsp;[**CLICK HERE**](https://t.e2ma.net/click/xyd2bd/5wd3tzj/hm9h2g){: target="_blank"}
