I hope your new year is off to a great start, and that it will be filled with many accomplishments\! Know that the quest for your dreams begins with a clear vision for what you want. The chances of successfully shaping the life of your dreams are substantially higher when you have a clear vision and clearly defined goals. Don’t forget, sometimes, that plan will need to be revised and adjusted as the goal takes shape. Once goals are determined and action plans are established, your desired lifestyle will begin to materialize and take shape.&nbsp; This will be different for everyone, but the process is the same. Let’s say that you determined in 2020 that you really enjoyed family time, but want to move it outdoors in 2021. Maybe that will require a large outdoor kitchen and dining area, or an in-ground pool, or a basketball court. Knowing what you want is the first step. Next, you need to create action steps such as contacting a contractor to show you options and pricing. Hold a family meeting and insure that the plan will bring joy to each member of the family. Maybe you will want to resume your travels in 2021, and if so, where will you go? What are the costs? Where will you stay? Now is the time to start planning and watch your dream lifestyle start to materialize\!

The \#1 thing that many people say happened during the pandemic of 2020 is that they started rethinking their life, their choices, and reimagining what they want for the rest of their life. Take a moment and dream about what you want your life to look like for the future. Check out, real quickly, this inspiring poem on How Your Dreams Come True.&nbsp;[**CLICK HERE**](https://t.e2ma.net/click/tn69ad/5wd3tzj/p8rl1g){: target="_blank"}
