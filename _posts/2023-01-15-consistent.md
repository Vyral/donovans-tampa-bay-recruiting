**WORD OF THE WEEK&nbsp;[CONSISTENT](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consistent)**

***‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not what we do once in a while that shapes our lives, but what we do consistently.‚Äù&nbsp;*[Tony Robbins](https://www.bing.com/search?q=tony+robbins+consistentcy+quotes+and+images&amp;qs=NW&amp;pq=tony+robbins+consistentcy+quotes&amp;sk=NW1&amp;sc=3-32&amp;cvid=CC421F75088F45BDB0179DECF7762D37&amp;setmkt=en-us&amp;FORM=QBRE&amp;sp=2)**

**Good Morning Friends,**

**They say that a stopped clock is right twice a day, but is that what you are willing to settle for in your life?&nbsp; Some people are content to sit and watch the world go by. They end up letting other people tell them what they should do most of the time. Whether it is their parents, their boss, their spouse, their friends or even a stranger\! They can‚Äôt be true to their own set of values or where their heart leads them because they are so busy going every which way trying to please others.**

**When you look back over the last year or two, is there something that gives you a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment?&nbsp; It may not be huge to the world but take time to give yourself a pat on the back and be proud of your achievements, no matter how small. Now, grab hold of that feeling and plan to take one small step daily to consistently move your life a little closer toward your goal\!&nbsp;**

**Maybe it‚Äôs a physical goal, an educational goal or something you just want to do because it gives you joy. For example, I am now coming up on the third straight year of writing a weekly blog and email post meant to encourage and inform friends, acquaintances, business associates and clients since the pandemic started. I am thankful and often amazed at the kind words of appreciation. When someone tells me that my post was just what they needed to hear on a Monday morning, it excites me and makes me more determined to continue the process\!**

**Today, why not take the first step by deciding on one thing that you can take action on this year? My bet is that if you make an effort to take small steps toward your goal and your dreams, by the end of this year, you‚Äôll be surprised at how far you‚Äôve come because of your consistency and thus being true to yourself\!&nbsp;**

**I will leave you with this quote from a song called Garden Party sung by Ricky Nelson: ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs alright now, I learned my lesson well, see you can‚Äôt please everyone, so got to please yourself‚Äù. \*P.S. Be sure to check out the Song of the Week below\!**
