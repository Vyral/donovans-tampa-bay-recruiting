**"Feelings"- according to Bob Dylan&nbsp;[CLICK HERE&nbsp;](https://t.e2ma.net/click/23np6f/y0qeoac/6enzno){: target="_blank"}&nbsp; &nbsp;**

**Good Morning\! &nbsp;&nbsp;**

**Traveling on a plane and writing a blog about feelings are not always compatible. The bumps and interruptions experienced during the trip&nbsp; sure have a way of interrupting one's thoughts. Then, it gets a little bumpy on the plane and try as we might, this wreaks havoc with&nbsp; "feelings" of calmness, clarity and concentration needed to write something meaningful\!&nbsp;**

**The travel experience is analogous to "life in general";&nbsp; the interruptions and things that happen cause us to have feelings other than the happy ones we were shooting for in our daily lives.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the book we are currently reviewing , called: &nbsp;[“The Happiness Trap” &nbsp;](https://t.e2ma.net/click/23np6f/y0qeoac/2zozno){: target="_blank"}by Russ Harris, he talks about 4 Myths regarding feelings of happiness:**

**Myth 1:&nbsp;*Happiness is the Natural State for All Human Beings***

**Myth 2:&nbsp;*If you're not Happy, You're Defective***

**Myth 3:*****&nbsp;To Create a Better Life, We Must Get Rid of Negative Feelings.***

***Myth 4: You Should be Able to Control What You Think and Feel***

**While we have all heard the above myths before and we wish that each chapter of our lives ended with "Happily Ever After", we know this is not realistic. For example - as you read this blog- try NOT to think of your favorite ice cream, how it tastes on a hot summer day, how refreshing and cool it is after your favorite meal, how it melts in your mouth...&nbsp;****&nbsp; Any luck on that?\! (I'm going out to buy some Ben & Jerry's right after this\! Now its hard NOT to think about that ice cream - LOL)**

**The reality is that thoughts, feelings, memories and sensations, good and bad, come and go minute by minute, day by day in our lives and rather than try to control each one, we can instead, acknowledge that this is a normal part of living and we can decide to live our lives and move forward despite these feelings.&nbsp; If we allow feelings to just "be" they will eventually change as a natural part of living and our feelings won't get in the way of living a happy life despite setbacks and disappointments\!

**Make it a great week and remember- feelings are just visitors - let them come and let them go\!**
