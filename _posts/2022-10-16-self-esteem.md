**WORD OF THE WEEK&nbsp;[SELF-ESTEEM](https://www.bing.com/search?q=self+esteem+definition&amp;cvid=025873c838e24723b945c8c46c36681a&amp;aqs=edge..69i57j69i64.11614j0j1&amp;pglt=675&amp;FORM=ANNTA1&amp;PC=U531)**

**Good Morning Friends,**

**How are you? Check in with yourself today and seriously see how you are. Nope – I don’t mean what you tell others, like; “I’m fantastic”, “very well thanks”, “couldn’t be better” … all the while inside you are saying to yourself, “if they only know how I really feel right now – I’m exhausted, depressed, really ticked off at someone, bummed out” …**

**This means your self- esteem might be a little bit low right now\!&nbsp; When you find that happening to you, here are 3 quick tips to “pick yourself up and get back in the race\!”.. As the old Chairman of the Board,&nbsp;[Frank Sinatra&nbsp;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra#:~:text=Frank%20Sinatra%20Francis%20Albert%20Sinatra%20%28%2F%20s%C9%AA%CB%88n%C9%91%CB%90tr%C9%99%20%2F%3B,the%20Board%22%2C%20and%20subsequently%20as%20Ole%20%27Blue%20Eyes.)used to sing about\!**

**1\.Create a self-esteem file: Whenever someone tells you something positive about what you did or gives you a compliment or you've done something you are proud of, add it to a journal or type it up in an email and send it to yourself\!&nbsp; This way you can save it in a folder and refer back to it on a day when your self-esteem isn't as great as it should be\!**

**2\. Think back to an activity, hobby or something you were passionate about in the past and re-ignite that passion. Did you used to enjoy gardening, taking a walk in the park or doing a project with your hands?&nbsp; Take a small step forward in that direction and see where it leads you. Your head will thank you.**

**3\. Make yourself a “don’t do list”. That’s right\! Boost your self-esteem by ditching some tedious or boring task that just brings you down and isn’t really that important anyway\! There’s always tomorrow and who knows, it just might take care of itself anyway\!\! Just say no.**
