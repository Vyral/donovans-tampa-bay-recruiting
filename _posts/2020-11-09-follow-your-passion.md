Have you heard the phrase: "life’s too short"?&nbsp; This has never been more true at this time in our world's and our country's history\!&nbsp; Life is too short to spend your life NOT feeling fulfilled or excited about what opportunities lie before you. While it may not always work to switch your job or move to your dream destination – you can find ways to follow your passion in so many ways. Choose a charity. Take a class. Learn a new trade. Volunteer. Take up a new hobby. Learn a new skill. Something that takes you out of the rut, away from complacency, a little out of your comfort ‘zone’ – and into something that adds purpose and passion to your life. There are so many things we can do that touch not just our futures but the lives of those around us - and we can ensure that we do that in such positive ways. Whatever you dream about doing that makes your eyes light up and a smile appear – do that\! Start today. And let me know if I can help. I’ve been a ‘fanner of flames’ for years. Just like Zig Ziglar says, “If you help enough people get what THEY want, you’ll always get what YOU want.” Anything I can do? Have a wonderful week\!&nbsp; Check out&nbsp;**T[ony Robbin's advice on Passion HERE](https://t.e2ma.net/click/lh844c/5wd3tzj/lxc3ug){: target="_blank"}**

**DIY Tip for the Week**

Have a&nbsp;*Passion*&nbsp;for a change without a lot of expense and work?&nbsp; How about changing the color of a room in your home? If you are changing to a totally different color - money saving tip - Prime walls with paint from the "oops" aisle. These returns at your paint or hardware store are sold at a fraction of the cost. Be sure to pick a matte finish in a shade that's lighter than your top coat. Cost: $1—$5. Savings: About $18 for a gallon of interior latex primer\! How about that for following your passion?&nbsp;**[Check out these quick painting tips HERE](https://t.e2ma.net/click/lh844c/5wd3tzj/1pd3ug){: target="_blank"}.**

**Real Estate Tip of the Week**

Have a customer or client who is&nbsp;*Dreaming*&nbsp;about buying or selling a home soon? Make sure you have them get an inspection so their dream won't turn into a nightmare\! (also a smart move from a liability standpoint as an agent\!) A home may look good on the surface but underneath the pretty exterior, there could be a deteriorating roof, termite infestation, or outdated electrical systems — you can't fix it if you don't know it's broken. It is smart to hire an inspector to check out the areas of the home that you don't normally see. They may discover hidden problems that could negatively impact a home's value. Small problems (such as a hidden water leak) can become big, expensive problems quickly and as realtors, could become a "nightmare" for us months later\!&nbsp; Check out a short clip I made a few years back - maybe you will make your own video and send it to your clients\!&nbsp; &nbsp;**[How to Avoid 5 Home Inspection Mistakes HERE.](https://t.e2ma.net/click/lh844c/5wd3tzj/hie3ug){: target="_blank"}**
