If you want to finish the year strong, I recommend that you start texting for dollars. Texting is a great way to get an immediate response from potential clients.

If you’re like me, as you approach the end of the year, you might think that you are running out of steam or you’re running out of people in your pipeline. However, you still want to finish the year strong. One way you can still end 2016 on a high note is to incorporate texting for dollars.

I don’t know about you, but if I get an email, I put it in my line of emails that I have to reply to and I might get to it or I might not. If I get a voicemail, the same thing happens. Sometimes my voicemails wait awhile for a response. But what about a text?

A text is immediate. People always have their phones on and people will see it right away. How do you text for dollars? Here is an example of a text you could send out:

“Hi Janet. The market’s really moving and prices are going up, up, up. Are you curious about your home’s value or know someone who needs my help???” Then, hit send! Hopefully, Janet will give me a call.

The fact of the matter is people are curious about their home’s value. Texting for dollars is a great way to get a CMA to someone who might be thinking about making a move this year or next year.

Who should you text? Anyone in your database who bought a house 10 years ago. Back then, the market was up kind of high, but it went down. Now the market is almost back to where it was, and it might be time for those homeowners to consider selling again because they should have enough equity to do so.

You should also text people who are thinking about retiring. A lot of people in the older age bracket pride themselves on being able to text, so this is a great opportunity to reach out to them.


In short, texting for dollars is a great way to finish the year strong. If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. Don’t forget to submit your questions for our next video; send me one and you will enter the contest for a $25 gift certificate. I look forward to hearing from you!
