***“The biggest communication problem is we do not listen to understand. We listen to reply." &nbsp;[Marc Accetta](https://t.e2ma.net/click/9rsmoe/5wd3tzj/97sdmi){: target="_blank"}***

**I’ve been thinking a lot lately about what the world needs most right now and what came to mind this week was the word, “[Understanding](https://t.e2ma.net/click/9rsmoe/5wd3tzj/p0tdmi){: target="_blank"}”.&nbsp; I found this little story that says it all. &nbsp;I would love it, if you could take 2 minutes to read it to start off or finish your day\!**

**"Once upon a time, a bird was searching for a home to lay her eggs and get shelter in the coming rainy season. In her search, she saw two trees and went to ask for shelter. When she asked the first tree. He refused to give her shelter. With disappointment, she went to the second. And the second tree, agreed**

**So, she made her home and laid her eggs in the second tree and then the rainy season arrived. The rain was so heavy that the first tree fell and was carried away by the flood\! The bird saw this and in a taunting way said: ”See, this is your karma, you didn’t offer me shelter, now God has punished you\!”**

**As he was floating by, the tree gently looked up and said: &nbsp;“I knew I was not going to survive this rainy season and that’s why I refused you. I didn’t want to risk the lives of you and your children.” Then he floated down river out of sight.**

**At that point, the bird got tears in her eyes. Now she knew the real reason for the tree’s refusal to give her shelter and felt new respect for the tree.**

**As we deal with other people who have different viewpoints from ours, maybe we should not always consider someone’s NO as their arrogance or ignorance. You may not know the full picture. Perhaps we don't understand their story.**

**We get so wrapped up in our own opinions and view points, that we forget to step back and try to see the other person’s&nbsp;[point of view](https://t.e2ma.net/click/9rsmoe/5wd3tzj/5sudmi){: target="_blank"}.&nbsp; Perhaps if we all try just a little, there may be some hidden good in all of us making the effort to be ... understanding\!&nbsp;**
