Giving Back&nbsp;*"As you grow older, you will discover that you have two hands - one for helping yourself, the other for helping others."&nbsp;*To Learn about Audrey Hepburn's work:&nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://youtu.be/1SvddNIlRaw?t=189)

**Good Morning\!**

**Summertime is perfect for fun and frolic. It’s also a great time to consider the value of giving back. I recently saw an article on “Give Back Tuesdays,” where families donate time and energy to giving back to their communities on Tuesdays – and I thought it was a terrific idea\!Here are some great ways to get your friends, relatives and colleagues involved in giving back:**

* **Share kindness with your neighbors.**
* **Volunteer virtually or share your talents**
* **Give your voice to a cause that matters to you**
* **Show gratitude to healthcare workers, service providers, and other essential workers who are making sure we still have the services we rely on, even at risk to their own health.**
* **Talk about giving and generosity using the hashtag \#GivingTuesday**
* **Discover a local fundraiser, community drive or coordinated event to join others in your area or with your same interests in giving back — they need your help. For suggestions:&nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://www.givingtuesday.org/blog/)**
