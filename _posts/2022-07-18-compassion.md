***"Walk a mile in my shoes. Before you abuse, criticize and accuse, walk a mile in my shoes." Written by&nbsp;[Joe South](https://t.e2ma.net/click/klrqtg/sbltq1c/o0hcdq){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;and also sung by&nbsp;[Elvis Presley](https://t.e2ma.net/click/klrqtg/sbltq1c/4sicdq){: target="_blank"}***

**An old Cherokee chief was teaching his grandson about life.**

**“A fight is going on inside me,” he said to the boy. “It is a terrible fight and it is between two wolves.”**

**“One is evil – he is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, self-doubt, and ego.”**

**“The other is good – he is joy, peace, love, hope,&nbsp;[serenity](https://t.e2ma.net/click/klrqtg/sbltq1c/kljcdq){: target="_blank"}, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity,&nbsp;[truth](https://t.e2ma.net/click/klrqtg/sbltq1c/0dkcdq){: target="_blank"},&nbsp;[compassion](https://t.e2ma.net/click/klrqtg/sbltq1c/g6kcdq){: target="_blank"}, and faith.”**

**“This same fight is going on inside you – and inside every other person, too.”**

**The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather, “Which wolf wins?”**

**The old chief simply replied, “The one that you feed.”**

**Today we focus in on compassion. Here are the 3 stages of compassion.&nbsp;**

**1\. You receive compassion.&nbsp; Don’t think you always have to be the strong one. You aren't being weak when you accept the compassion of others.&nbsp;[Allowing others to care for us is important and crucial during the times in our lives where we are vulnerable.](https://t.e2ma.net/click/klrqtg/sbltq1c/wylcdq){: target="_blank"}**

**2\. You have self-compassion. When you care enough about yourself, you take care of yourself. It is not necessarily selfish to take time out for self-care\!

**3\. Showing compassion for others. It normally starts with feeling compassion for those you know and care about,&nbsp; but then it extends outward to others who may be strangers. Focusing our energy on helping others or&nbsp;[making the world a better place](https://t.e2ma.net/click/klrqtg/sbltq1c/sjncdq){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;gives great meaning in our lives.**

**We each have a choice. We can focus on anger, resentment and lies or, instead, we can focus on serenity, compassion and truth…**
