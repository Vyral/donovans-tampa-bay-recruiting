If you keep calling someone but they won’t call you back, what can you do to get ahold of them? Here are three tips that will solve this problem.  

First, **you can call, hang up if you get their voicemail, call again, hang up again if you get their voicemail, and then call one more time.** What’s the point of calling three times in a row? Speaking for myself, if my husband calls me three times in a row, there’s probably an urgent reason why and it means I should pick up the phone.

Another option is to use Slydial. With this program, you can connect directly to their voicemail and leave a message without calling them. 

If either of these tips fail, you can always just knock on their door. If they’re not home, try leaving a note. Sooner or later, they’re bound to call you back.
