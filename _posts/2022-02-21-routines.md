***&nbsp;******"******A Champion doesn't become a champion in the ring, he's merely recognized in the ring. His "becoming" happens during his daily routine."&nbsp;*****[Joe Louis](https://t.e2ma.net/click/37qiqd/zwff20l/fl9e6e){: target="_blank"}**

**Good Morning\! &nbsp;**

**Stress is tough.&nbsp; For many of us, a lack of structure and routine has actually magnified the distress of the last two years during the pandemic. As hard as handling stress is, it is not impossible to get this under control. Setting up and sticking to daily routines can lower your stress levels, help you feel healthier, more productive and more focused.&nbsp;**

**Your relationships, your business and your life will actually become stronger and you will stay on pace for the year ahead with sound routines. Here are 2 quick tips about routines that will put you on firm footing this year, despite having to deal with unknown factors that are thrown your way.**

**1\. FOCUS ON THINGS YOU CAN CONTROL:&nbsp; Create your standard&nbsp;[wake-up](https://t.e2ma.net/click/37qiqd/zwff20l/rybf6e){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;and&nbsp;[bedtime](https://t.e2ma.net/click/37qiqd/zwff20l/7qcf6e){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;routines as well as&nbsp;[meal time routines](https://t.e2ma.net/click/37qiqd/zwff20l/njdf6e){: target="_blank"}. Set specific, measurable and achievable goals for times you wake up and go to bed, what activites you do in preparation for bed as well as what activities you do when you get up.&nbsp; Also plan out the times you eat, what you will eat and where you will eat it.**

**2\. TAKE TIME TO BE MINDFUL OF YOUR ROUTINES. In the&nbsp;["Happiness Trap"](https://t.e2ma.net/click/37qiqd/zwff20l/3bef6e){: target="_blank"}, that we've been reading the last month or so, author Russ Harris recommends picking a daily routine, such as&nbsp; mundane chores like house cleaning. For example, when you wash the floor, notice each little detail about&nbsp; the job: the swish of the mop, the water in your bucket, the scent of the floor cleaner, the shiny floor when you are done….When your thoughts wander, acknowledge this and then bring your mind back to the activity at hand.&nbsp; Having a set day and time for an activity, as well as paying attention to each little step in your task, will keep you on track, help it feel like a little game you are playing with yourself and hopefully lead to overcoming the urge to put it off\!&nbsp;**

**Don't forget to structure your day to make the most of your&nbsp;[energy levels](https://t.e2ma.net/click/37qiqd/zwff20l/j4ef6e){: target="_blank"}. You will get more done in your daily routine and it will help you get what you need in terms of rest and relaxation too\!**
