Have you ever heard the phrase, “A watched pot never boils”? When you want something to happen, paying attention to it will make the wait feel much longer.

How long have the last three months felt like–really? Eternity? If that’s how you are feeling, you can join the millions or others around the world who are feeling the same way\! A day seems like a week, a week seems like a month, and a month feels like a year because we are caught up in a continuous loop of information, disinformation, stress, and just waiting to see what will happen next.

It’s time to stop watching and start doing. Do anything\! Learn a new skill. Take on a new hobby. Read. Write. Reach out to others. Get outside in your garden or go for a half hour walk in the park.

Many people are suffering from depression right now, and the sense of uncertainty because there seems to be no“finish line” date to when the virus will be eradicated.

“Change your thoughts and you change your world,” are still wise words to live by. If your only focus is the chaos and crisis in the world, your mind and body have only fear and grief to fuel it. When you shift your focus to creativity, productivity, and hope – you give yourself a gift of more peace, energy, and joy. &nbsp;When you do – you’ll inspire others to do the same – bringing more light into a world that could really use it. So, leave the “pot” to do what it will do. Watch, instead, things that will deliver new perspectives, skills, and peace of mind. Its all about how you spend your time\!

**Something to Think About&nbsp;**It was just four months ago that all of us were saying, “I need more hours in my day.” Now we have that time, so don’t waste it waiting for things to go back to the way they were. Embrace the now\!&nbsp;[**Here is some interesting information about time\! Click Here**](https://youtu.be/hIsuN0XOQoY)
