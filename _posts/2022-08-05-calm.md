**INSPIRATION FOR YOUR WEEK AHEAD: WORD OF THE WEEK:&nbsp;[CALM](https://youtu.be/r-KTObnrWfU)&nbsp;**

***"The nearer a man comes to a calm mind the closer he is to strength."*&nbsp;‚Äî&nbsp;[Marcus Aurelius](https://theinwardturn.com/marcus-aurelius-on-learning-to-focus-the-mind/)**

&nbsp;

**Good Morning Friends,**

**Have you ever observed someone who just seemed to exemplify calmness? &nbsp; You know, they had a serene, pleasant look on their face?&nbsp; Their body language was relaxed and they really appeared to be enjoying what they were doing, whether it was at work, a hobby or on vacation? They just seemed to be ‚Äúchilled out‚Äù. No stress, no tapping their foot or texting frenetically on their phone or arguing heatedly with someone else over their disagreements\!**

**Is feeling calm and exhibiting calmness something we are born with or something we can learn?&nbsp;**

**I think it‚Äôs probably a little of both\! Here are 3 traits of Calm people that we can learn from and easily adapt in our own lives**

**1\. Note that when someone who is calm is talking to you, they make&nbsp;[eye contact](https://youtu.be/uWpNlIjSDWY)&nbsp;and pay full attention to what you are saying. As they listen, they are fully present and make the other person feel like they are really understood.&nbsp; When you do this, it not only helps the other person feel calm, but in return, their positive reaction makes you feel good and calms you down\!&nbsp;**

**2\. Calm people are relaxed people.&nbsp; The reason they give off a calming vibe is because they have made time in their life to get&nbsp;[enough rest](https://youtu.be/9_0otsrMf28), good nutrition and hydration and a good dose of exercise like walking plus spending time with positive people.&nbsp; If you find a calm person ‚Äì let some of these vibes rub off on you. Likewise, if you are a calm person ‚Äì make sure and share your inner calm with others when the opportunity presents itself\!**

**3\. A calm person is also a&nbsp;[trustworthy person](https://youtu.be/RAWFfr1unPE?t=20). Have you ever noticed that some people hardly ever gossip?&nbsp; If they aren‚Äôt blabbing the secrets others share with them, chances are, they will treat the conversation with you in confidence as well.&nbsp; People who have an inner serenity, do not feel the need to feel superior by gossiping about others. This allows you to build a bond of trust that becomes a safe haven for those in distress to regain their calm\!\!**

**OK ‚Äì so what is one easy and quick method to regain your CALM if you are stressed out or someone gets to you?&nbsp; The simplest answer is- BREATHE: Take slow deep breaths in through your nose. Hold your breath in, then exhale through your mouth.&nbsp; Close your eyes, relax and let go of control.**

**Here is a cool acronym for B.R.E.A.T.H.E.:&nbsp; Be, Receive, Experience, Acknowledge, Transform, Heal, Evolve. If you want to go into more detail about how to get more CALM in your life ‚Äì check out the post:&nbsp;**[CLICK HERE&nbsp;](https://vacayou.com/magazine/power-of-breath/)
