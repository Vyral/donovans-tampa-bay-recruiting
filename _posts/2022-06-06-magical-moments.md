***“If you pay close attention to each day, you will discover the magic moment."[&nbsp;Paulo Coelho](https://t.e2ma.net/click/2zs6nh/q6p3gvi/y0eheq){: target="_blank"}***

**I bet you can recall the times a truly&nbsp;[magical moment](https://t.e2ma.net/click/2zs6nh/q6p3gvi/etfheq){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;happened in your life. Our brains do a funny thing when we connect with a magical moment - we create a photographed memory that lasts a lifetime and beyond\!**

**In these turbulent and heart-breaking events of the last few weeks, I think about the families who now have only those magical memories to hold on to as they remember and honor their child or loved one whom they have lost forever. &nbsp;**

**Many who have been through such a horrific experience say they were so thankful that they had those special moments with their loved ones while they were still with them. Others only express regret at all the things they had intended to do but never got around to.**

**Here are 3 things you can do to start creating some Magical Moments in your life:**

**1\. Have an adventure - Now of course, that Disney or Hawaii vacation or a cruise are the first ideas that come to mind, but how about just a short (save on gas) road trip to somewhere new close to home? Even a downtown restaurant you’ve never visited could prove to be memorable. Don’t forget to take home a souvenir and snap a couple of photos that you can print out later and hang on your&nbsp;[“Magical Memories” wall](https://t.e2ma.net/click/2zs6nh/q6p3gvi/ulgheq){: target="_blank"}\!**

**2\. Just say No – Most of us get so tied up in bringing work home or doing things just to please someone else, that we never take time just to smell the coffee or the roses or listen to and appreciate those close to us. &nbsp;Don’t forget to put down your cell phone, turn off your smart watch and just BE with family or friends. Give your undivided attention. That’s where the real magic happens.**

**3\. Don’t wait to&nbsp;[Celebrate](https://t.e2ma.net/click/2zs6nh/q6p3gvi/aehheq){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;– When you celebrate some event, no matter how minor, it becomes special. For example, the day your child gets a special certificate, starting a holiday tradition that you normally don’t celebrate or making a special occasion when there is a new accomplishment or purchase you are proud of. You’d be surprised at what people remember about even the smallest things in life that were made special\!**

**Life is too short to waste on inattention, annoyance and impatience with friends, family and our fellow man.**

**Starting today, why not make a promise to yourself and those you care about to take the time to create magical moments? &nbsp;Turn the ordinary into the extraordinary. These are the magical moments that will live on in the hearts and minds of those we care about even long after we are gone\!**
