***&nbsp;"Intuition is a very powerful thing, more powerful than intellect."&nbsp; - Steve Jobs did this 1 weird thing consistently when coming up with a big idea\!&nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://t.e2ma.net/click/g68yuf/sbltq1c/w2o58o){: target="_blank"}***

**Good Morning\! &nbsp;**

**Did you ever stop to think about how birds use their intuition to navigate their way to breeding grounds halfway across the world? Deer, rabbits, and other prey use their intuition to avoid running into predators. The average human, on the other hand, will take the advice of a total stranger, or the person who sits at the desk next to them instead of doing what they know, deep down inside, is the right or best thing. How many times have you thought, in hindsight, I knew I should have&nbsp;[listened to my gut](https://t.e2ma.net/click/g68yuf/sbltq1c/8fr58o){: target="_blank"}?**

**Every one of us has incredible inner guidance that we can use whenever we need it. For example, there may be someone you’ve heard a lot of bad things about from co-workers, friends or neighbors. But instead of jumping to conclusions, you decide to speak to them or interact with them and use your intuition while observing your direct experience with that person. &nbsp;You may find out that the person is nowhere nearly as bad as their reputation, they might just be a victim of gossip or hitting a&nbsp;[string of unavoidable circumstances](https://t.e2ma.net/click/g68yuf/sbltq1c/o8r58o){: target="_blank"}. If not for using your sense of intuition, you would have dismissed this valuable human being\!**

**&nbsp;When there is an important decision to make, don’t run around asking everyone what you should do. Instead, find a quiet place and give yourself time to feel, think, and contemplate. You have all the answers inside of you. Practice sharpening your intuition, take the time to strengthen your connection to your own&nbsp;[inner voice](https://t.e2ma.net/click/g68yuf/sbltq1c/40s58o){: target="_blank"}, and trust that you know what’s best for you. The more centered and tuned-in you are, the mightier you will be\!&nbsp;**
