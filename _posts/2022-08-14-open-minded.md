**INSPIRATION FOR YOUR WEEK AHEAD:**

**WORD OF THE WEEK&nbsp;[OPEN-MINDED\!](https://youtu.be/J2Qrm9UB7qY)**

***"Minds are like Parachutes - they function better when they are open.&nbsp;*[Tommy Deware](https://www.answers.com/Q/What_does_the_quote_%27Minds_are_like_parachutes_They_only_function_when_open%27_mean)**

**Are you Open-Minded?**

**Have you ever met a person who was totally the opposite of you? They had different viewpoints and tastes in everything: lifestyle, food, religion, politics\! The list could go on, but in other words, they were&nbsp;[total opposites\!](https://www.powerthesaurus.org/total_opposite/synonyms)&nbsp;Yet somehow you managed to get along and have mutual respect and even appreciation for each other.**

**Open mindedness is not necessarily a personality trait or something you are born with (though many people do develop open-mindedness or its opposite - closed mindedness from parents and social organizations they are exposed to as children). An open-minded point of view shows that you are willing to listen to what others have to say, even if it appears that they disagree with you.**

**Wouldn‚Äôt the world be a better place if all human beings could make an effort to be a little more tolerant and a little more understanding? Here are 3 ways that you can train your brain to be more open-minded.**

**1\. Like who you are. Embrace your insecurities. The first step in accepting other people for who they are, is accepting yourself for who you are. As Ricky Nelson said in the song&nbsp;[‚ÄúGarden Party‚Äù](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Ricky+Nelson+garden+party&amp;cvid=dd2a7374b54240739e683a55293da405&amp;aqs=edge..69i57.10743j0j1&amp;pglt=771&amp;FORM=ANNTA1&amp;PC=U531)&nbsp;‚Äì ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt please anyone, until you learn to please yourself\!‚Äù**

**2\. Appreciate people for who they are. &nbsp;Understand that we all have unique differences and perspectives. Don‚Äôt expect to&nbsp;[change the other person](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/inviting-monkey-tea/201603/you-cant-change-someone-else-you-can-do). Just learn to like and respect them for who they are\!**

**3\.&nbsp;[Challenge your perspectives](https://www.lifehack.org/868287/perspective-on-life). Seek to explore why you think the way you do. Consider whether your views on things are so tightly held that you would be unwilling to consider a different point of view - even in the face of conflicting evidence. Be grateful not only for the times when people agree with your perspective but also for the times they do not because it is in moments like this that you have the golden opportunity to do one of two things; shut down the other person and dismiss them because their views do not coincide with yours ‚Äì or be open-minded and willing to learn and grow into the kind of open-minded individual our world so desperately needs these days\!**
