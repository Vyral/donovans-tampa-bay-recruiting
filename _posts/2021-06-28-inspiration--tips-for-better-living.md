**Good Morning\!**

**As the world is opening up and we are reentering society and going out to social events, there are mixed emotions. Some are nervous, while others are excited. This is a time to respect other’s decisions and feelings.**

**Here are some thoughts as we move forward:**

**1\. &nbsp;It's going to take time. The same light switch that turned us off overnight is not going to turn us back on overnight. It's going to be a while before we're 100% mask-free, and 100% comfortable, and that's ok.**

**2\. &nbsp; Everyone will come back at their own pace. Everyone's situation and comfort level is different. Give people space to handle the change on their own timetable.**

**3\. &nbsp;Be patient. Be patient with yourself and others. It wasn't easy to stop doing what we always did, and it won't be easy to continue to learn new technologies or find hybrid ways of doing business. Give grace whenever wherever you can.**

**4\.&nbsp; Maintain the slower pace. It was the silver-lining of the pandemic. It permitted us to be more present and patient in our daily lives and to appreciate all the little things.**
