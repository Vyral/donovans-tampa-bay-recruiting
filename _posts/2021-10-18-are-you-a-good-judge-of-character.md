***"Character is not something that you buy; it is not a commodity that can be bartered for; it is not a quality suited for only the rich and famous; rather, character is built upon the foundational commitment of love, honesty and compassion for others."&nbsp; Byron R. Pulsifer***

**Good Morning\! &nbsp;&nbsp;**

**What you do is important, but what is even more important is who you are. That’s what defines your character. It’s how you treat others and how you make others feel. &nbsp;[Robert Sutton (](https://t.e2ma.net/click/svw39e/sbltq1c/kdlwfo){: target="_blank"}Author of the Asshole Survival Guide), defines character as, “the difference between how a person treats the powerless versus the powerful.” Those of great character always treat other people, no matter their rank or status, with courtesy and consideration.**

**What virtues are you showing in your behavior? As many famous people have written, your character is one thing you always want to be aware of, because your character determines your reputation. Actions speak louder than words. A wise man once said, “Character is what you do when you think no one is looking”.**

**Something to Think AboutCharacter is something that we can all have, and that we can continually work to achieve or to improve upon. It does not require money or a degree. It requires a desire to be the best that you can be and to treat others with respect, kindness and consideration.**

**Make it a great week and remember - "Actions speak louder than words\!"&nbsp;**
