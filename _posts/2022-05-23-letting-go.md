***“We must be willing to let go of the life we have planned, so as to have the life that is waiting for us."&nbsp;[E.M. Forste](https://t.e2ma.net/click/xarkse/hmthfkv/dnn6pi){: target="_blank"}r***

**Have you ever felt exhausted without doing any physical work? People can get emotionally and physically tired from trying to&nbsp;[solve a problem](https://t.e2ma.net/click/xarkse/hmthfkv/tfo6pi){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;that is bothering them or staying focused on something that they are not happy with. This is because mental thinking processes are as laborious as physical ones. Both can leave you drained and exhausted.&nbsp; The same is true with emotions. When your mind is&nbsp;[overwhelmed](https://t.e2ma.net/click/xarkse/hmthfkv/97o6pi){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;with too much information and too many sensations, it works harder to keep your body safe and working properly.&nbsp; This is both physically and mentally draining and can leave you feeling exhausted.**
