*"Never get so busy trying to make a living, that you forget to make a life" Dolly Parton*&nbsp;&nbsp;**[CLICK HERE](https://youtu.be/vJOhnuy53AM)**

Good Morning\!

Who would have thought, as we celebrate this 2021 Labor day weekend, that we would still be continuing &nbsp;to battle the challenges of COVID. We are reminded of how important it is to keep our immune system strong and to stay healthy. When we talk about staying healthy, that includes not only the obvious physical factors, but mental, emotional, social, and even spiritual factors as well.

In today’s world, it’s important that we give an equal amount of attention to areas of our health that are tied to wellness, not just dealing with medical issues that may arise. &nbsp;As the saying goes, "If you don't take time for your wellness, you will be forced to take time for your illness." For example, a nutritionist might recommend ways to eat healthfully. A therapist might recommend ways to cope with stress such as yoga and meditation. A chiropractor keeps our bodies in alignment, which supports a strong immune system and helps our bodies stay strong.

When we fail to give the proper attention needed to keep our bodies and minds strong and healthy, the result is illness and disease. Throughout many parts of the world, physicians give medical advice and treatment, along with holistic remedies to assist in healing. Now is the time to be more vigilant in seeking out each of these health providers and creating a health wellness plan that encompasses not just the absence of physical disease, but involves healthy habits, thoughts, coping mechanisms, and peaceful ways of relating to our environment and to others.
