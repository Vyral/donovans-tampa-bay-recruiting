[**Stay a Steady Course**](https://t.e2ma.net/click/8v359c/c7u94x/w2grkl){: target="_blank"}

It’s easy to get discouraged when your plans and goals do not materialize the way you envisioned they would. After all, aren’t we taught that if you set a goal, create action steps, and follow through, your goal should materialize? Well, sometimes it’s not that easy. Life is filled with distractions and obstacles (including unexpected pandemics\!) that may have pushed you off your path or delayed your journey. The first step is to stop and look at how far you have come. Then ask yourself, what is keeping me from moving forward? There is a great phrase used in the context of war or a battle, and that phrase is "Stay the course". It means maintaining a constant, unaltering course while pursuing a goal regardless of any obstacles or criticism. What a great strategy when it comes to goals. For 2020, have you stayed the course? (If you did, hats off to you in the midst of all that has gone on\!)

**Something to Think About**

Human beings have been getting distracted from their goals for centuries. In fact, Socrates and Aristotle developed a word to describe this type of behavior: Akrasia. Akrasia is the state of acting against your better judgment. It is when you do one thing even though you know you should do something else. Loosely translated, you could say that akrasia is procrastination or a lack of self-control. Akrasia is what prevents you from following through on what you set out to do.&nbsp;**[Read More About Akrasia HERE](https://t.e2ma.net/click/8v359c/c7u94x/snirkl){: target="_blank"}**.

**Weekly Activity&nbsp;**If your akrasia is getting in the way of your goals, address it\!&nbsp; Many times, we procrastinate out of fear or anxiety – especially when it comes to doing something we know we should do. That’s when it’s important to do those activities first thing in the day and put it behind you. When you do – everything else is smooth sailing. Choose a day this week to get started on whatever you've been putting off and just take one step that day and each day thereafter. A journey just begins, they say, with a single step\!&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Words of Wisdom**

*Successful people maintain a positive focus in life no matter what is going on around them. They stay focused on their past successes rather than their past failures, and on the next action steps, they need to take to get them closer to the fulfillment of their goals rather than all the other distractions that life presents to them. – Jack Canfield*

*Only put off until tomorrow what you are willing to die having left undone. - Pablo PicassoYou may delay, but time will not. – Benjamin Franklin*

*You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream. – Les Brown*

*Desire is the key to motivation, but it is determination and commitment to an unrelenting pursuit of your goal - a commitment to excellence - that will enable you to attain the success you seek. – Mario Andretti*

*A goal is a dream with a deadline. – Napoleon Hill*
