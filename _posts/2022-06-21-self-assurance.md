***May Your Choices Reflect Your Hopes, Not Your Fears" …&nbsp;[Nelson Mandela](https://t.e2ma.net/click/ygrlqh/q6p3gvi/aiolhq){: target="_blank"}***

**As we look around the world, it’s easy to see why so many people say that it’s challenging lately to have much confidence in the future. Inflation is skyrocketing, driving up the cost of everything from food to fuel, at the fastest rate in more than 40 years. War in Ukraine has many concerned for loved ones and rebuilding. New strains of the virus seem to pop up daily and folks are just tired of it all\! If you focus on what is “not good” it’s almost impossible to remain&nbsp;[self-assured](https://t.e2ma.net/click/ygrlqh/q6p3gvi/qaplhq){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;about how to react to all these changes.**

**James Allen, in his book&nbsp;[*As a Man Thinketh*](https://t.e2ma.net/click/ygrlqh/q6p3gvi/62plhq){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;says, “We ourselves are makers of ourselves.” What a profound statement. What he seems to be saying is that our thoughts, images, beliefs, and activities help create the person that we become.**

**In my mind, being self-assured means having a sense that you can make it through what life throws your way. Believing that you can go through the darkest tunnel and come out the other side a winner and all the better for your experience.&nbsp;**

**Life is hard, we don’t always know which way to turn or what to do. Self-assurance is having acceptance of this and still giving it your best shot. As hockey Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky said: “You Miss 100% of the Shots You Don’t Take”.**

**Why not determine today to sit in the driver’s seat of your own life and have self-assurance knowing that you have within you the ability to make the right choices and you can be&nbsp;[your own biggest advocate](https://t.e2ma.net/click/ygrlqh/q6p3gvi/mvqlhq){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;even in situations where the ride gets a little bumpy\!**
