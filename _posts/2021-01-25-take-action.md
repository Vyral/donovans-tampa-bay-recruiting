Here's hoping you will have an amazing week\!&nbsp; I found this poem and wanted to share it with you. It really ties together everything that we have been talking about in our Monday Morning Wake Up Call in January. It’s called “Don’t Just”, and it’s written by Roy Bennett from his book,&nbsp;***The Light in the Heart***.

**Don't Just**

Don't just learn, experience.

Don't just read, absorb.

Don't just change, transform.

Don't just relate, advocate.

Don't just promise, prove.

Don't just criticize, encourage.

Don't just think, ponder.

Don't just take, give.

Don't just see, feel.

Don’t just dream, do.

Don't just hear, listen.

Don't just talk, act.

Don't just tell, show.

Don't just exist, live.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;**Roy T. Bennett &nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://t.e2ma.net/click/9bkpcd/5wd3tzj/p0p22g){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;**&nbsp;for the poem set to music
