**&nbsp;*****“Mother's Love is PEACE. It need not be acquired, it need not be deserved."&nbsp;[Erich Fromm](https://t.e2ma.net/click/sjnchg/sbltq1c/oockyp){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;***

**One day I overheard the teacher tell the inspector that I was “addled” and it would not be worthwhile keeping me in school any longer. I was so hurt by this that I burst out crying and went home and told my mother about it.&nbsp;**

**Then I found out what a good thing a strong mother is. She came out as my fierce defender. Mother love was aroused, and mother pride was wounded to the quick.**

**She brought me back to the school and angrily told the teacher that he didn’t know what he was talking about.&nbsp; In fact, she was the most enthusiastic champion anyone could ever have, and I determined right then that I would show her that her confidence was not misplaced.**

**The man telling the story about his mother’s love and commitment is&nbsp;[Thomas Edison](https://t.e2ma.net/click/sjnchg/sbltq1c/4gdkyp){: target="_blank"}.**

**One of the most prolific and ingenious inventors of all time, Thomas Edison was homeschooled until he set out on his own at the at of sixteen, openly grateful for his mother’s support and education throughout his life.**

**Not only can we acknowledge Edison’s mom, who enabled young Thomas Edison to eventually light the way for us all, (literally), but we can also acknowledge all moms who respond with love, courage and wisdom every day.**

**Today, on this Mother’s Day, Sunday - May 8th, 2022 may you celebrate a mom, aunt, sister or caring woman in your life - or their memory with gratitude\!**
