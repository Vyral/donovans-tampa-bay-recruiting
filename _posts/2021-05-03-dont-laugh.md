**We are all bombarded with media images and information designed to create fear and chaos – and whether we realize it or not, that can wreak havoc on our moods and mindsets and keep us from embracing the good stuff each day that is right there for the taking. Remember that old saying “Laughter is the best medicine”?&nbsp; Turns out – it really is. One pioneer in laughter research, William Fry, claimed it took ten minutes on a rowing machine for his heart rate to reach the level it would after just one minute of hearty laughter. And laughter appears to burn calories, too. What? How's that for a bonus?**

**Maciej Buchowski, a researcher from Vanderbilt University, conducted a small study in which he measured the number of calories expended in laughing. It turned out that 10-15 minutes of laughter burned 50 calories\! &nbsp;It’s proven to increase blood flow, immune response, and positively affect our blood sugar levels and our ability to sleep and relax. Healthy heart, systems, and a calorie burner? Sounds like something we should all sign up for every day-right? So, whether you are a busy business executive, realtor, empowering parent, engaged friend or family member, or all of the above, this week, challenge yourself to proactively seek out sources of LAUGHTER. Share it often throughout each day and see how it changes the course of your week – and the week of those around you.&nbsp; Need a good Laugh right now? &nbsp;**[**CLICK HERE**](https://t.e2ma.net/click/9vbgnd/5wd3tzj/d7updh){: target="_blank"}
