*"Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships" -The Power of Good Teamwork* - Michael Jordan&nbsp;**[CLICK HERE](https://youtu.be/2oIo4UjCXO8?t=12)**

Good Morning\! &nbsp;&nbsp;

In business, sports, family life or even the clubs and organizations you belong to, the team you build determines the success of all. It’s about working together, sticking together, having common goals, and having each other’s backs\!

Here are the five common traits of top team players:

**Self-awareness:&nbsp;**Self-awareness helps you understand what strengths you have, and which areas offer you the greatest potential. It enables you to figure out where to direct your efforts to improve yourself and your skills.

**Passion:** If you lack passion for your work, you’re in for an unpleasant grind. People who love what they do don’t mind the hard work that goes with it. Their passion gives them energy. Passion is something everyone has to discover on their own. When you figure out what excites you, focus your energy there.

**Discipline:** What most people mistakenly regard as luck is in fact the natural consequence of seizing opportunities through careful planning, preparation, and effort. This translates as hard work. Discipline yourself and spend the time necessary to master your craft.

**Coachability:** Are you trainable? Are you willing to learn, to improve yourself, and to work constantly to get better? Coachable people put their egos aside. They know they’re not perfect, and they’re ready to learn.

**Confidence:** If you apply the above four qualities every day, you will develop unshakeable self-confidence. Your hard work and determination show you who you are, what you want, and what you can accomplish.
