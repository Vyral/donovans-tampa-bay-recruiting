***“If you focus on the actions of others and allow them to constantly upset you, then you are handing your peace over to them and giving away your power.&nbsp; -&nbsp;[Victoria Osteen](https://t.e2ma.net/click/9ziske/5wd3tzj/5w1dii){: target="_blank"}***

**Each of us actually has a well of unlimited, and sometimes, untapped&nbsp;[power&nbsp;](https://t.e2ma.net/click/9ziske/5wd3tzj/lp2dii){: target="_blank"}at our disposal. For most, it’s a matter of believing in it, trusting it, and then harnessing it. &nbsp;How would you like to use YOURS? To help yourself succeed? To be part of something bigger? To help others where you can?**

**It is amazing what we can do as human beings when we tap into our voice and value systems to make the world around us even the tiniest bit better. I love the story of 6- year-old&nbsp;[Ryan Hreljac&nbsp;](https://t.e2ma.net/click/9ziske/5wd3tzj/1h3dii){: target="_blank"}as a shining example of what’s possible. As a first-grade student, Ryan learned about the devastating consequences for people without access to safe drinking water. He rallied his community to help him raise the money needed to build one well in Uganda, Africa. 20 years later, Ryan’s Well Foundation consists of a team of people committed to providing access to safe water and sanitation as a way to improve lives in developing countries. &nbsp;[Ryan’s Well Foundation](https://t.e2ma.net/click/9ziske/5wd3tzj/ha4dii){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;has raised over $1 million for 878 water projects and 1,120 latrines in 16 countries. He believed in something and used his power to make a difference.**

**[Ryan’s story is extraordinary](https://t.e2ma.net/click/9ziske/5wd3tzj/x24dii){: target="_blank"}, especially when you consider how many would not give a whole lot of credence to how much power a first grader could have.&nbsp; Now, imagine how much power YOU have. &nbsp;Imagine the difference you make and can make in ways both big and small in the world around you. Tap into it. Believe in it. Harness it. The world needs more of that\!**
