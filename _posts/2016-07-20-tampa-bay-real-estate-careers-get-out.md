Welcome back to another edition of our blog highlighting real estate tips, trends, and strategies. The summer is when many agents get into a slump in their business. If they had a good spring, they feel fine with the slump as it happens, only to regret it toward the end of the year.

Many agents I’ve spoken to over the years tend to blame their lack of summer production on a lack of good leads. When we first got into the business, we decided to make a list of everyone we knew. We made a commitment to add to that list daily and send those folks on our list relevant and interesting information on a periodic basis. A lot of agents I talk to think this is a great idea, but make excuses for themselves like not having enough time to get a list together or not knowing enough people.

If you’re slowing down a bit during the summer, this is a great exercise. Make a list of all the people you know, and make a commitment to add to that list. I really want to help you do this, so I will be doing two things for you as well, personally. First, I’ll send you a dynamite memory jogger to help you remember those people you always seem to forget. Secondly, I will be your accountability partner for one week. Tell me how many names you want to add to your database in a week's time, and I will be in contact with you to make sure you're successful.

If you have any questions for me at all, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. Your real estate success is my concern. As always, make it a great day!
