It is the start of a new month filled with hope and anticipation for the new vaccine and the year ahead. Hope is what gets us through the challenging times. Hope gives us strength in times of uncertainty. Hope is the rope that we can cling to when we aren’t sure what the future holds. Hope keeps us grounded and brings us together. It is an optimistic state of mind that is based on an expectation of positive outcomes with respect to events and circumstances in one's life or the world at large. I can’t imagine a world without hope and I hope that what lies ahead in 2021 is everything that you are hoping for.

**Something to Think About**

We are in control of how we look at life and circumstances. We can expect that everything is going to be a disaster, or we can hope for and expect that it will all work out. It is a choice we can make every day. Get encouraged -&nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://t.e2ma.net/click/mbzu2d/y0qeoac/aywitl){: target="_blank"}
