**Have You Run Into a Brick Wall Lately? &nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://youtu.be/Cww-9LHXf1w?t=11)**

***“People who avoid the brick walls -all power to ya, but we all have to hit them sometimes in order to push through to the next level, to evolve.” - Jennifer Aniston***

**When we run into a brick wall, you know, a roadblock, a problem, something that seems to stop us from moving forward in the direction we want to go. What is the first thought that comes into your mind? “I should just give up…” “I’m sure I did something wrong…”&nbsp; “I knew that was more than I could handle…”**

**But this type of response might not be the solution\! &nbsp;Maybe we’ve run head-long into a wall and we just need to climb over it, go around it or crash through it\!**

**The great skateboarder Tony Hawk was just 10 years old when he grabbed his brothers skateboard and took off on it. Before long he saw a wall in front of him. Desperate, he asked his brother how to turn. No answer. No answer. No answer… And then BAM\! Tony Hawk hit the wall.**

**And with hitting the wall, Tony’s career could have been over. He could have said “I hit a wall. I must be doing something wrong. I need to quit.”**

**Instead, Tony got back up, hopped onto the skateboard, and went in the other direction. As you can guess, he eventually learned how to turn on a skateboard plus much, much more.**

**This is like the difficulties we face in our lives; We’ll be heading for our dreams; a new position at work, a new level in our marriage, mastering a skill we’ve been working on. Only to face an overwhelming obstacle.**

**When we see this obstacle, we freeze in our tracks and… decide to give up\!**

**No\! No\! No\! Instead, look at the event in the grand scheme of things. Decide what’s important. See if this is an obstacle that can be overcome.**

**Is the brick wall really the end of the road for pursuing your goal? What do you do when things get tough? Do you run away, dig your heels in and stubbornly make the same mistakes over again or do you strategize, reflect, practice and learn from your failures so that you can go back out there and overcome that obstacle, that brick wall, once and for all? How badly do you want it?&nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://youtu.be/McLlCrU4kaQ)**

**Make it a great week and remember - “Brick walls are there to stop the people who don’t want it badly enough\!“&nbsp;**
