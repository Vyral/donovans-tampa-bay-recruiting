***“If you want to thank a soldier, be the kind of American worth fighting for" Unknown***

**They were quite the pair — she, a beautiful young girl with a cheerful smile; he, a&nbsp;[homeless veteran](https://t.e2ma.net/click/e15mmh/q6p3gvi/a6ilcq){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;with a scraggly beard and weathered face. Their friendship started out slow. The girl began saying “hi” to Tony as she traveled to and from her workplace. Soon enough they were having small conversations and then regular talks and periodic lunches. “Tony tells me about his war stories, loved ones, and who should win the Super Bowl,"&nbsp;****she wrote****&nbsp;in a Dec. 5, 2012, post on Reddit. “I tell Tony about my problems, loved ones, and how I don't really care&nbsp;****who should win the Super Bowl\!”**

**From an outsider’s point of view, it seemed the young girl was offering the old, lonely man an ear. But the friendship was reciprocal. Recently, the girl went through a&nbsp;[difficult period emotionally](https://t.e2ma.net/click/e15mmh/q6p3gvi/i4mlcq){: target="_blank"}, and Tony reportedly helped her navigate those tough personal choices. One day she was walking around feeling sorry for herself when she felt a tap on her shoulder. She turned to find Tony giving her a concerned look. He had something for her, he said. “From his army jacket, he pulls out a watch head. Tony takes my hand and gently places the broken antique in my palm.” He went on to say: “I don’t have much but I wanted you to know that you have done what many others would not simply by being my friend.” As Tony walked away, she started to cry. At that moment a realization took hold.&nbsp; The girl realized that when you extend yourself to those in need: “You&nbsp;[get back not only what you gave,](https://t.e2ma.net/click/e15mmh/q6p3gvi/aaqlcq){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;but infinitely more.”**

**As this Memorial Day gives us another opportunity to honor and remember our fallen heroes and war veterans, may this simple story remind us all that heroism does not always take place in a blaze of glory and gunfire. Sometimes, small, seemingly insignificant&nbsp;[actions of kindness&nbsp;](https://t.e2ma.net/click/e15mmh/q6p3gvi/mnslcq){: target="_blank"}can change not only the course of our individual lives but the course of history as well\!**
