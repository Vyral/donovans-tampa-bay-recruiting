I’ve heard a lot about stand-up desks, and how it might be great to already be standing-up when others approach your workspace. Standing-up, compared to sitting all day, prevents back problems and other pains. Your arms are at a nice resting place.

 However, I didn’t want to go out and spend a few hundred dollars on a brand-new stand-up desk. I ended up learning about this awesome company called Oristand. I ordered this desk, similar to cardboard, that looks great. It’s also affordable and portable. I can move it around, take it down, and bring it home with me.

 You add your laptop or computer monitor to the top shelf, and add a wireless keyboard to the bottom one. It goes on top of your desk or other surface, transforming your previous workspace into something trendy and healthy. When you start working, you can turn your computer on and are ready to go. You’re already eye-level with your computer. Your arms and shoulders feel relaxed, since you aren’t scrunched into a sitting position.

 When you’re talking to clients, you have a lot more energy and flexibility when you’re standing. The other day, I noticed one of our team members leaned over on their laptop. After a while, I could tell she ran out of energy because her neck looked like it hurt. If you have some shoulder pain, or would like a change in lifestyle to benefit your health, consider investing in an Oristand stand-up desk. It’s a great way to learn if this type of desk is for you!

 If you have any questions about today’s video, or anything else, give me a call or send me an email. I’d be delighted to help you!
