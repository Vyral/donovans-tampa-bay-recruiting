Did you ever stop to think about how birds use their intuition to navigate their way to breeding grounds halfway across the world? Deer, rabbits, and other prey use their intuition to avoid running into predators. The average human, on the other hand, will take the advice of a total stranger, or the person who sits at the desk next to them instead of doing what they know, deep down inside, is the right or best thing. How many times have you thought, in hindsight, I knew I should have listened to my gut?

Every one of us has an incredible inner guidance that we can use whenever we need it.&nbsp; When there is an important decision to make, don’t run around asking everyone what you should do. Instead, find a quiet place and give yourself time to feel, think, and contemplate. You have all the answers inside of you. Practice sharpening your intuition, take the time to strengthen your connection to your own inner voice, and trust that you know what’s best for you. The more centered and tuned-in you are, the mightier you will be\! Want to learn more?
