This season often brings with it a good bit of reflection. This year will be quite different from holidays past and it will most likely live in our memories for a long time to come.(and maybe not with fond memories for sure\!)&nbsp;

Let's face it, when you reflect on the past, the things that you remember most tend to be words and interactions you had with a friend or loved one that you are either happy about or have come to regret. While there is still time, take a moment to consciously stop and listen to those you care about. The need to be understood and listened to is a basic human need, yet sadly, most of us neglect working on this basic skill.&nbsp;

The next time your child, grandchild, mom, dad, spouse, grandparent, friend or client wants you to listen to them -&nbsp;*stop*, put the phone down, turn the T.V. off and stop fidgeting reading your email\! Take the time to look them in the eye and be present. Really listen to what they have to say in an open-minded, non-critical way. Not only does this help them feel loved and cared about, but I helps you as well. &nbsp;It is said that those who listen to others well can also listen to themselves\!&nbsp;**[CLICK HERE FOR 9 TIPS ON MASTERING THE ART OF LISTENING..](https://t.e2ma.net/click/l1bd9c/5wd3tzj/ps7qzg){: target="_blank"}&nbsp; &nbsp;**

Take the time to learn how to listen, before time runs out\! Life is short (as we have all learned for sure this year.)&nbsp; Don't live your life with regret. Invest the time now so your "Memories are Evergreen" and truly comforting and happy ones\!

**Memories Are Evergreen - words &nbsp;by Karen Donovan**

*If I could turn back the hands of time, and chase away the years.&nbsp;*

*Happy Memories come to mind, of people I hold dear.*

*Just like a Christmas tree with branches shiny bright,*

*it brings back memories evergreen,*

*they glimmer in the night.*

*Memories are Evergreen, shine like diamonds on the snow,*

*Memories are evergreen, little faces all aglow,*

*Hold on tight to faded dreams, even if from long ago*

*and in December when we remember, we'll know memories are Evergreen.*
