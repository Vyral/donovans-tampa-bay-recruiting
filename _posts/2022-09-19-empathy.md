**INSPIRATION FOR YOUR WEEK AHEAD:**

**WORD OF THE WEEK&nbsp;[EMPATHY](https://www.bing.com/search?q=definition+of+empathy&amp;cvid=ebbe0ef617c940d1a0fc7a1d5294fb5b&amp;aqs=edge..69i57j69i64.9551j0j1&amp;pglt=2083&amp;FORM=ANNTA1&amp;PC=U531)**

**&nbsp;‚Äú****Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting and communicating that incredibly healing message of - you are not alone."&nbsp;****&nbsp;&nbsp;****[Albert Einstein&nbsp;](https://www.bing.com/search?q=albert+einstein+empathy&amp;form=ANNTH1&amp;refig=868a64c3507b4a1e8d6632ac627e22ca&amp;sp=1&amp;qs=NWU&amp;pq=albert+einstein+empathy&amp;sk=PRES1&amp;sc=8-23&amp;cvid=868a64c3507b4a1e8d6632ac627e22ca)**

**Good Morning \[%member:first\_ name default="Friends"%\],**

**This week I was thinking about the plight of others less fortunate in our society. When we witness event after gut wrenching event, where you just scratch your head and say ‚Äúwhat the heck were they thinking to do that??\!‚Äù&nbsp; Most empathetic folks can‚Äôt help but put themselves in the unfortunate person‚Äôs shoes.&nbsp;**

**Do you have empathy? Having empathy means your heart goes out to another person in joy or pain. It means you have the ability to identify with or understand another‚Äôs situation or feelings.&nbsp;****Are you an empath? Take the empathy quiz&nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://psychologia.co/empathy-test/)**

**The good news is that 98% of people are able to empathize with others.&nbsp; The few exceptions are psychopaths, narcissists and sociopaths who are generally unable to understand or relate to other people‚Äôs feelings and emotions.**

**Maya Angelou once said, ‚ÄúI think we all have empathy. We may not have enough courage to display it.‚Äù &nbsp;As we see unprecedented events unfold daily, whether due to climate change, political, social, world or economic events, ask yourself this question: do we, as a country and as individuals have the courage to empathize with the people and circumstances that many find themselves in, or do we brush off their predicament with disdain and impatience? &nbsp;**

**I once heard a close friend express his belief that people who were homeless, poor or ‚Äúdown on their luck‚Äù, were at fault for their predicament, since there was something they had obviously done to deserve being in that situation\! Seriously??\!\!**

**The next time you hear about an unfortunate thing that has occurred to someone, take the time to not only empathize with the people and their situation, but step forward and volunteer to take action to alleviate the situation in some way. Try turning your&nbsp;[empathy into concrete action.&nbsp;](https://personalexcellence.co/blog/empathy/)&nbsp;If we all make a concrete effort, I truly believe that our little part of the world may just have a chance to become a brighter, better more compassionate and empathetic place\!**
