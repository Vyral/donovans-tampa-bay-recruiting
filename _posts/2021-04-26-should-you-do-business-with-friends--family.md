***Friendship is one of the biggest building blocks of our lives. When we were younger, it felt like it was all about the NUMBER of people in our social circle. As we get older, however, it’s clear that it is not the number of friends that we have but the quality of those connections. With the right people, time, distance, money – none of that matters. What does matter is that underlying knowledge that no matter what, or where, or when, you’ll be there for each other. That’s more valuable than almost anything else in the world -- especially now. Spring is an incredible time of renewal and life. Why not step out and make a new friend or client or renew a relationship in a positive way? Check out a short clip on 3 quick tips about doing business with friends & family\! &nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://t.e2ma.net/click/xqbvmd/5wd3tzj/dnnadh){: target="_blank"}***
