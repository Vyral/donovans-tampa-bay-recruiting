Good Morning\! Friends, Since Halloween is just around the corner, I thought we'd dust off this little spoof video we had fun doing a few years back about the&nbsp;**[Energy Vampire](https://t.e2ma.net/click/mr349c/y0qeoac/u9ugij){: target="_blank"}\!**&nbsp;Whatever you do in your walk of life, I'm sure that at one time or another you've run into "that guy"\! Whether you are a homeowner or a buyer looking for a home or a real estate professional, we all at one time or another have dealt with workmen, co-workers, clients, friends or family members who might fit this category\! Energy vampires have the sense that the whole world revolves around them. &nbsp;They are emotionally needy and complain a lot and at times very critical of you and others. They are often not able to see things from some else's perspective. So, what can you do to protect yourself from having your energy "sucked out of you"?

1\. Be aware when someone is making you feel drained. 2. Take a deep breath - maybe a long walk or take some time doing something that brings you joy\!&nbsp; 3. Set your boundaries and just say no if you feel like they are trying to control you.&nbsp; 4. Take a look at yourself. Is it possible you are attracting or allowing this type of person to act this way through fear or by not taking control of your situation?
