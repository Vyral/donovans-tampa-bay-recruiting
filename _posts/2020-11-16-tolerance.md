Today is International Tolerance Day. It is observed each year on November 16th to raise awareness to the importance of tolerance in our society. In a world filled with such rapid change, divisiveness, and even fear – there has never been a better time to come together, lean into the common denominators that remind us that we are more alike than different. We don’t have to always agree to be kind. We don’t have to have the same religion, political views, or economic status to recognize that as human beings, we are all in this world together. The Golden Rule is still one of the absolute best – treat others as you would have them treat you. That really is at the heart of what tolerance is all about.&nbsp;***How Tolerant Are You?***&nbsp;&nbsp;[**Take this 5 Question Quiz Now.**](https://t.e2ma.net/click/zg3qec/zwff20l/j0f5be){: target="_blank"}
