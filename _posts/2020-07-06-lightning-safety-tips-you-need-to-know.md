As the dog days of summer approach, so does the likelihood of thunderstorms and lightning – especially for those headed to their favorite beach vacation spots\! Did you know that lightning is hotter than the surface of the sun and can reach temperatures of 50,000 F? I didn’t either until I started doing a little homework\!

**Here are some great safety rules of thumb:**

* Avoid open fields, the top of a hill or a ridge top.
* Stay away from tall, isolated trees or other tall objects. If you are in a forest, stay near a lower stand of trees.
* If you are in a group, spread out to avoid the current traveling between group members.
* If you are camping in an open area, set up camp in a valley, ravine or other low area. Remember, a tent offers NO protection from lighting.
* Stay away from water, wet items, such as ropes, and metal objects, such as fences and poles. Water and metal do not attract lightning, but they are excellent conductors of electricity. The current from a lightning flash will easily travel for long distances.

If you’d like to learn more about lightning to share with your family and friends, head over to Weather.gov for some interesting&nbsp;[**myths vs. facts here.**](https://t.e2ma.net/click/2bmhpc/6imx8m/2f9h0h){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Are you in danger INSIDE your house?&nbsp;**Actually, although its much safer inside - strong lightning can still find a path inside your home\! We have all heard of an appliance getting zapped or a circuit breaker tripped due to lightning. In a severe lightning storm you should stay off all corded equipment that could put you in direct contact with electricity. You should also avoid contact with plumbing fixtures, stay away from windows, doors and porches and do not lie on concrete floors or lean against concrete walls.&nbsp;

**Words of Wisdom**

*Thunder is good, thunder is impressive, but it is lightning that does the work. -Mark Twain*

*If you are caught on a golf course during a storm and are afraid of lightning, hold up a 1-iron. Not even God can hit a 1-iron. - Lee Trevino*

*Human life is as evanescent as the morning dew or a flash of lightning. - Samuel Butler*

*The difference between the almost right word and the right word is really a large matter - 'tis the difference between the lightning-bug and the lightning. - Mark Twain*

*Nothing good bursts forth all at once. The lightning may dart out of a black cloud; but the day sends his bright heralds before him, to prepare the world for his coming. - Augustus Hare*

Stay safe and Make it a Great Week\!
