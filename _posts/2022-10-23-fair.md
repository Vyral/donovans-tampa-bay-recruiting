&nbsp;**"Fairness is man’s ability to rise above his prejudices." –Wes Fessler**

**Good Morning Friends,**

**“That’s not fair\!” the girl said, as she stomped her foot and folded her arms. The young, green-eyed girl looked with disdain as the other kids from camp all pretended to ignore another girl who was “different”, excluding her from their fun and leaving her alone with tears in her eyes. The green-eyed girl walked over to her and put her hand on her shoulder, “don’t worry”, she said – we’ll find our own fun things to do…. And they did.**

**A number of years later, that same green-eyed girl was in college. In her music class for teachers, they were given a test to demonstrate their proficiency in playing a song on a&nbsp;[recorder in order to lead music for their future students.&nbsp;](https://www.thatmusicteacher.com/blog/benefits-of-teaching-recorder)Each took a turn at the simple song until they got to a student who had forgotten her recorder.&nbsp; The teacher stated that since she hadn’t been organized enough to remember her instrument, she would get a failing grade.&nbsp; The green-eyed girl looked down at her recorder, raised her hand and said to the teacher, “well if she had a recorder and played the song, she would pass – right?” The teacher then took a vote and the class all agreed this would be fair, so the green-eyed girl promptly lent the forgetful student her recorder so she wouldn’t fail…. And she didn’t\!**

**Life throws all of us curve balls from time to time. It seems that we have two choices: One is to follow the golden rule: “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you”. The other one I call the greedy rule: “Selfish people are the ones who use the weakness of others for their own gain”.&nbsp; The green-eyed girl somehow understood it as a kid, that whenever possible, do your best to try to make things fair. Fairness sometimes requires us to step a little bit out of our comfort zones and give someone who needs it a pat on the back.&nbsp; Sometimes it requires us&nbsp; to raise our hands and point out what is right and what is fair. I can guarantee that if you do make the effort and step up to the plate, in the end you WILL make a difference ….And you'll be glad you did\!**
