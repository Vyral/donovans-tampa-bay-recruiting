*"Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is not to stop questioning"&nbsp;*Albert Einstein - What can we learn from Einstein's quirky habits? Warning - he had some really quirky, but cool habits\!&nbsp;**[CLICK HERE](https://youtu.be/YWX1RKHNL4k)**

Good Morning\!&nbsp;

UCLA’s head basketball coach, John Wooden, won 10 national championships, including seven in a row in 1973. Since then, only two Division One basketball teams – Florida and Duke – have won back-to-back championships.

Wooden was a standout coach because he worked hard, paid attention to details, and stuck to the hard, unsung, dirty work of the basics. At the opening of each season, he would teach his players how to&nbsp;[“put on their socks and shoes.”&nbsp;](https://youtu.be/SSiq1mnYh6I)With any other coach, 18-year-old basketball players might laugh at these instructions, but his athletes followed his advice. Were Wooden’s socks-and-shoes regulations micromanagement gone haywire? Not at all. Few of his players suffered blisters, rashes or “chaffing.” In contrast, their opponents often suffered aching feet by the end of their games. It’s tough to play winning basketball when your feet are on fire. For Wooden, winning required controlling every game factor he could command and not wasting his time on anything else.

### Something to Think About

Great coaches and top athletes teach that success depends on what you do – and how you do it – every day. Winning requires the accumulation of positive habits and focus.

In sports and business, focus is everything. But for focus to work, you must know where you’re going and what you need to do to get there. To discover that, ask yourself six questions:

1\. &nbsp; What must I sacrifice to get ahead?

2\. &nbsp; What skills must I have?

3\. &nbsp; Whose help do I need?

4\. &nbsp; What are the challenges I must face?

5\. &nbsp; What bad habits must I eliminate?

6\. &nbsp; What good habits must I develop?

Success comes with a heavy price you alone must pay by doing everything you can to change your life for the better. Knowing what to do matters. Doing the necessary work matters even more.
