**It’s been one full year of Covid and many say they’ve reached a breaking point. They’ve simply had enough: Enough of being inside. Enough of working remotely. Enough of having businesses shut down. Enough of schools being closed. Enough of being isolated. Enough of everything\!**

**The common message is I just can’t do this anymore. If you are feeling that way, you are not alone.**

**The COVID-19 pandemic has changed all of our lives in a multitude of ways. And after months of being stuck inside, limited exposure to friends and family, and juggling responsibilities at home and at work, it’s no surprise that many are dealing with frustration.**

**Things are changing, science is helping, and we’re getting there. It’s more important than ever to practice self-care and take a solid moment to recognize your resilience, strength, and ability to navigate change. As human beings, it is built right in our DNA to do just that. Give yourself credit for how far you’ve come, start making plans for where you’ll go next, and give thanks for the better days just ahead\! Check out 26 folks who have had enough\!&nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://t.e2ma.net/click/72l2vc/zwff20l/ry3cne){: target="_blank"}**

**Something to Think About - I love this quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson, “What lies behind you and what lies in front of you, pales in comparison to what lies inside of you.”&nbsp; You’ve got more strength and resilience than you know all right there inside you. Kudos to you for that.**

**Weekly Activity- Reach out to at least five people you care about and help them to acknowledge their resiliency through this. In doing so, they’ll feel better, you’ll feel better, and perhaps you’ll start a&nbsp;[kindness train](https://t.e2ma.net/click/72l2vc/zwff20l/7q4cne){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;that keeps going for a while\!&nbsp;**
