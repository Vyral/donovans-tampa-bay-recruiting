Have you been keeping up with John Krasinski's magical YouTube series he created to help people during this time called "Some Good News"? It really is magical. It's designed to help us discover the incredible moments of humanity and positivity in all that we are going through around the globe. It will make you laugh, and sometimes cry, but it is an anchor in good that is so powerful these days. I've got it dialed up to watch every week - and I hope it lasts longer than all this craziness, because it is truly a difference maker. If you haven't checked it out yet, here is the link to subscribe:&nbsp;[***John Krasinski's Good News\!***](https://t.e2ma.net/click/7mp6wb/nnwg7ob/7u7hwd){: target="_blank"}

I hope it makes you smile\!&nbsp;

**DIY Tip for the Week&nbsp;**Check your washing machine fill house. A leaky house can lead to big water damage and costly repairs. Be pro-active\! (Don't learn this the hard way - LOL).

**Weekly Activity&nbsp;**This week think of just one person you haven't spoken to in a while and do something - make a phone call, drop off a special treat or just some groceries - do something to put a smile on their face and show them that you care\! .
