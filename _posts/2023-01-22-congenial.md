**Happy Monday Friends!**

**WORD OF THE WEEK -&nbsp;[CONGENIAL](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/congenial#:~:text=Congenial%20means%20friendly%2C%20pleasant%2C%20or,as%20in%20a%20congenial%20workplace.)&nbsp;*****â€œI was in a beauty contest once. I not only came in last, I was hit in the mouth by Miss Congeniality".&nbsp;[Phyllis Diller](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=phyllis+diller+movies+and+tv+shows)&nbsp;***

**Our quote this week offers tongue in cheek humor by comedian Phyllis Diller about the meaning of congenial! Recently I overheard two people having a disagreement about something. You know - one accuses the other of taking something or doing something that annoys them and the other denies it and it just escalates from there!&nbsp; Conversely, you may have also heard a diplomat or a conflict negotiator who was a natural at diffusing an argument and calming the other person down instead of letting things escalate to the point where tempers flared.**

**This week if you run into a situation where you are not seeing eye to eye about something with a friend, client or relative - why not play the "congeniality" card?&nbsp; Smile, take a deep breath and try to listen first to what the other person is saying and why they are upset. Then repeat what you understand them to be saying and make sure they agree with your assessment. Then ask if there is a solution or compromise that might be acceptable. Know that many disagreements can not be solved but both sides might find some type of middle ground, even if it is to agree to disagree for now. I guarantee it might not solve your problems but it could make your a bit more congenial this week and remove some of the additional stress in your life!&nbsp;**
