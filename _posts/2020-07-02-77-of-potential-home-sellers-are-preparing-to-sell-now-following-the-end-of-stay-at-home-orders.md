Did you know that the latest Realtor's Report states that:

***77% of Potential Home Sellers are Preparing to Sell Now following the end of Stay-at-Home orders\!***

Despite the unavoidable fact of the coronavirus pandemic, many of us still have to deal with "regular" issues like selling our homes.

I am sending you this message because at one time you contacted me about a Home Value Report or an Estimate of your home's value.The good news is that "Plenty of buyers also appear ready to take advantage of record-low mortgage rates and the stability that comes from these locked in monthly payments for future years."â€¦says NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun.

That being said, here is a question: If I had a pre-qualified buyer who was willing to pay you a price acceptable to you for your home and was would also allow you to move in the time - frame you wanted. Would you consider selling your house?

If you even had an inkling of selling this year, but had thought it was impossible given the current situation - why not reconsider?&nbsp;

Reply to this email or give me a call or text on my cell: 516-822-1442 so that we could at least have a five minute conversation to explore your options and see if this decision is right for you.

If you have already sold or changed your mind - please feel free to pass this info on to a friend and also let me know your plans have changed\!
