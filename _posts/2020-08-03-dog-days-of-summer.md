As we head out of summer, I thought it would be fun to share what I just learned about the&nbsp;[**“*Dog Days of Summer”***](https://t.e2ma.net/click/kljcdd/sbltq1c/w2cgpl){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;which will officially come to an end next week. They are traditionally the 40 days beginning July 3 and ending August 11. This time frame coincides with the morning rise of the Dog Star, Sirius. Long ago people thought that the “combined heat” of Sirius and the Sun caused summer’s roasting temperatures. According to The Old Farmer’s Almanac for Kids, Sirius is the brightest star in the sky, other than the Sun. Under the right conditions, it can even be seen with the naked eye during the day. Sirius is one star in a group of stars that form the constellation Canis Major, meaning “Greater Dog.” It’s no surprise, then, that the nickname of this big, bold star is Dog Star. To find Canis Major: Imagine a straight line through Orion’s belt. Move your eyes left (south) until you come to a very bright star—that’s Sirius, the nose of the dog. Look further south to find a triangle of stars that marks the dog’s hindquarters. I hope you enjoy a little late summer stargazing\! And I hope you know I’m here if you need me for any of your real estate questions or needs\! Enjoy your August\!

**Reflections on August**

Did you ever have the summertime experience of jumping into the pool on a really hot summer day, bracing yourself for the shock of it all, but knowing that you will be better for it? Doesn't that experience summarize some of the most challenging moments of our lives, when we have to stop just putting our toe in the water, and instead jump in, head first? Be proactice this month and take control. Maybe its something you've been procrastinating about....As the saying goes - "Just Do It"

**Real Estate Tip of the Week**

Speaking of water, one of the biggest causes of home damage is water. Knowing how to TURN IT OFF, is something every homeowner should know. Find your water shutoff valve, which will be located where a water main enters your house, and ensure that every adult in your household knows where it is and how to close it. You may even want to put a little oil on the valve stem to make sure it’ll work when you need it to. (I know from experience - one of my shutoffs was frozen open this week lol.&nbsp; I found a great quick guide to water shut off from the good folks at The Spruce.&nbsp;[Read it here.](https://t.e2ma.net/click/kljcdd/sbltq1c/cvdgpl){: target="_blank"}

**Words of Wisdom**

*Summer afternoon, summer afternoon; to me those have always been the two most beautiful words in the English language. Henry James*

*August, the summer's last messenger of misery, is a hollow actor. Henry Rollins*

*My ideal summer day was reading on the porch. Harold E. Varmus*

*Every year, August lashes out in volcanic fury, rising with the din of morning traffic, its great metallic wings smashing against the ground, heating the air with ever-increasing intensity. Henry Rollins*
