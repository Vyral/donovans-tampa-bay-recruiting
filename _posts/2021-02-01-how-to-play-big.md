I love this quote, by Nelson Mandela, “There is no passion to be found playing small - in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living.” Mr. Mandela knew something, of course, about dreaming big and overcoming tremendous obstacles. We are all given the same number of minutes each day to fill up in whatever way we choose. We can dream big, or small. When people think about playing big, about taking a chance, often they have mixed emotions. On the one hand, they want to make a greater impact on those around them and live out the dream they feel they are meant to do, but on the other hand, they already feel overloaded and stressed with what is on their plate.

We can rejoice or worry. &nbsp;We can see opportunity or challenges. The truth is that the amount of work is the same. The difference all starts in the seeds of our mindsets. My definition of playing big is about following your dreams instead of your fears. If you are ever down or need inspiration, about anything, whether it be about homeownership or just life,&nbsp; check out this little clip from Rocky IV - you'll come back fighting\!&nbsp;[**CLICK HERE**](https://t.e2ma.net/click/reg1mc/zwff20l/j429he){: target="_blank"}

**Words of Wisdom&nbsp;**

*My Favorite - "It ain't about how hard ya hit. It's about how hard you can get it and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done\!" ROCKY*

*Playing big doesn't come from working more, pushing harder, or finding confidence. It comes from listening to the most powerful and secure part of you, not the voice of self-doubt.” Tara Mohr*

*Each day holds a surprise. But only if we expect it can we see, hear, or feel it when it comes to us. Let's not be afraid to receive each day's surprise, whether it comes to us as sorrow or as joy It will open a new place in our hearts, a place where we can welcome new friends and celebrate more fully our shared humanity. Henri Nouwen*
