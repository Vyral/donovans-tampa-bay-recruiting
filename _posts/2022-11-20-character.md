**WORD OF THE WEEK&nbsp;[CHARACTER](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+character%3F&amp;oq=what+is+character%3F&amp;aqs=edge..69i57.4974j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)**

***"When your goal is to bring together the country in a substantive way to say that we're united by values and more - that are - you know, stronger than the things that divide us. That could be a moment." &nbsp;[Michael Gerson](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/michael-gerson-longtime-newshour-commentator-dies-at-58)***

**Good Morning Friends,**

&nbsp;**Our word for this week is Character. I was drawn to this word after hearing of the passing of writer, columnist and White House speechwriter, Michael Gerson.&nbsp; Prior to this, I did not know much about him, other than I had heard him speak a few times on T.V. &nbsp;When I heard his story, the word ‚ÄúCharacter‚Äù jumped immediately to mind\!**

**Maybe there‚Äôs someone you think about that epitomizes the word ‚ÄúCharacter‚Äù when I tell you his story:**

**Michael was a deeply religious man who felt, no matter what, he should stand up for the principals he believed in.&nbsp; Even though his views were sometimes at odds with many who were in his circle, he stood up for injustice and against lies and wrongdoing on the part of others who were supposed to be leaders of our country. &nbsp;He carried on throughout his career even though affected by depression, a heart attack, then Parkinson‚Äôs disease and then subsequently finding out he had terminal kidney cancer\! He died this week at the young age of 58.&nbsp; Most would have dropped altruistic pursuits and instead tended to their illness. Most would have felt excused from continuing to fight the fight and to right the wrongs.&nbsp; But up to the end, it was impressive to hear how Michael stood up and spoke up for what he knew was right even amidst the pain.&nbsp; For more about this inspiring story about Michael Gerson&nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/remembering-my-friend-mike-gerson/)**

**As I reflect on this story, I am also reminded of a famous statesman in history with strong character, who has withstood the test of time. &nbsp;I bet if you think for a moment, you will guess who I am referring to\!&nbsp; Though he had character flaws as the rest of us do, this statesman learned from his mistakes, overcame defeat, and as president, stood up for what was right and treated people with honesty, humility, courage, justice and grace. Of course, we are talking about Abraham Lincoln.&nbsp; Even in his lifetime, people were impressed by him. After his tragic end and to this day, we are still attracted to the character of Abraham Lincoln. Do you know this Fun Trivia about Abraham Lincoln?
