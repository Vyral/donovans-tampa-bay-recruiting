Good Morning\! &nbsp;

Lately, I have seen first-hand that people all around us are pulling themselves up, opening their minds to new ideas and possibilities and taking advantage of the opportunities that are out there\! Even in the middle of all the stress, negativity and worry that is going on in these crazy times, there is always room for some Good News\!

As our original “Good News Wednesday Show” live on Facebook and You Tube every Wednesday is proving, even though the sensational headlines are vying for your attention, just about daily, there is also the choice for each of us to look at either the dark side or the bright side of life.

If you’ve read any of my blogs over the last year and a half, you know I vote for looking at the bright side - the glass is half full side – the optimistic side\!&nbsp; Here are 3 Qualities that Optimistic people seem to have that we can all strive for:

* Optimistic People Don’t Listen to Negativity – They believe in&nbsp; possibility. When someone tells them that what they want is impossible – they believe that even if they can’t change the direction of the wind, they still have the power to change their sail in order to reach their destination.
* Optimistic People often show Gratitude – No matter what happens, they value the outcome and feel grateful for it. Even when things don’t go their way, they know there is no point in showing a sulky face because they can't change the situation, but they can change themselves.
* Optimistic People Seek Out Other Positive People – As the saying goes “A positive life can never come from a negative mind”.&nbsp; Energy is contagious – either positive or negative. When optimistic, smiling people surround themselves with other positive people, just saying a cheerful “good morning” to a friend, loved one, co-worker or neighbor the synergy is amazing and contagious\!

To get started (or continue) on your path to living an optimistic life, ask yourself these 3 questions right now:&nbsp;

* How can I do what I do every day even better?
* What are the “endless possibilities” I can envision today about my life, my career and what I can potentially do for others?
* Why am I not doing it?
