**INSPIRATION FOR YOUR WEEK AHEAD:**

**WORD OF THE WEEK&nbsp;[FRIENDLY](https://youtu.be/cNIg45GZ_ts)**

***"*‚ÄúFriendship isn't about whom you have known the longest... It's about who came, and never left your side. ‚ô•‚Äù*****&nbsp;*[Mikaela Tiu](https://theysaidso.com/quote/mikaela-tiu-friendship-isnt-about-whom-you-have-known-the-longest-its-about-who)**

**Good Morning Friends,**

**What does it mean to be friendly? Sure, a nice smile and an out-going demeanor go far to give you the appearance of being "friendly", but what does it mean to be a "Real Friend?" (as opposed to a "[Fair-weather friend\!](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/fair-weather+friend)")**

**Here are some questions to think about that are simple reminders of what makes someone a real friend:**

**Some friends have never seen you cry. A real friend has shoulders that have been soggy from your tears.**

**Some friends don't know your parent's first names. A real friend has texted your parents.&nbsp;**

**Some friends bring a dish to your party. A real friend comes early to help you cook and stays late to clean up..&nbsp; &nbsp;**

**Some friends want you to be more like them. A real friend likes you just as you are.&nbsp;**

**Some friends expect you to always be there for them. A real friend will always be there for you.&nbsp;**

**Friendship Day was first celebrated in 1930. It was organized by&nbsp;[Joyce Hall, creator of Hallmark cards](https://corporate.hallmark.com/about/j-c-hall/). It is celebrated on July 30th of each year but there is always National Hugging Day which is coming up on January 21st\! No matter what the day, everyday is a good reason to celebrate all your real friends who allow you to be the same for them\!**
