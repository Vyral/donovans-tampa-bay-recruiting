**INSPIRATION FOR YOUR WEEK AHEAD:**

**WORD OF THE WEEK&nbsp;[ANTICIPATION\!](https://youtu.be/sZgmSo_8560)**

***"Remember this: Anticipation is the ultimate power. Losers react: leaders anticipate.*&nbsp;â€”&nbsp;[Tony Robbins](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=tony+robbins+on+anticipation&amp;docid=608029440957027676&amp;mid=650F062A0F12FED9BC68650F062A0F12FED9BC68&amp;view=detail&amp;FORM=VIRE)**

**Think about how you felt when you were looking forward to Christmas eve, your first day of summer vacation, an upcoming tropical vacation or even a delicious dinner out with friends â€“ what did you experience?&nbsp; Anticipation, of course\!**

**Websterâ€™s dictionary defines anticipation as the&nbsp;[feeling](https://www.bing.com/search?q=excitment&amp;cvid=444d14dc0e44425e94c338ae34f8fa91&amp;aqs=edge..69i57j69i59j69i60l2j5l3j69i60.16567j0j1&amp;pglt=515&amp;FORM=ANNTA1&amp;PC=U531){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;of&nbsp;[excitement](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/es/diccionario/ingles/excite){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;about something that is going to&nbsp;[happen](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/es/diccionario/ingles/happen){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;in the near&nbsp;[future](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/es/diccionario/ingles/future){: target="_blank"}.**

**When we anticipate something, we are looking forward to we feel happy. Research studies show a connection between anticipation and the feeling of hopefulness and life satisfaction.**

**Sometimes, the anticipation of an event is just as pleasurable (or even more so) as the actual event or the memories afterwards\!**

**Actually, the importance of focusing on looking forward to something, offers several benefits that we might not have realized:&nbsp;**

**1\. Anticipation motivates us and gets us excited about the future.**

**2\. When we are excited about upcoming events, we also become motivated to assure that we are focused, prepared and ready.**

**3\. In the midst of making preparations for an upcoming, anticipated event, there are many types of health benefits that follow, such as; our out-look on life, mood, focus and general well-being.**

**Just think about a time when you were looking forward to a tropical vacation where youâ€™d be&nbsp;[wearing a swimsuit](https://www.wikihow.life/Look-Great-in-a-Swimsuit).&nbsp; In preparation, you may have decided to eat better, get some additional exercise and even shed a few pounds\!**

**The bottom line is that if you feel your life is lacking inspiration and purpose these days, why not try to reflect on some event or activity that you looked forward to in the past or that sounds appealing to you now?&nbsp; Once you find just a little spark, that will put a glimmer of joy back in your life.&nbsp; Even if itâ€™s as simple as curling up with a good book, taking a long hot shower or going out for a coffee with a friend.&nbsp;**

**Anticipation is a skill we can develop if we stop and think about how to create it. It can bring back the happiness, hopefulness and joy that seems to have eluded us these past few years.**
