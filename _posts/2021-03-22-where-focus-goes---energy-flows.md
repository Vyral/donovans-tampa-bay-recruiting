At a time when there is so much negative info in the world, it's time to pay attention to what you are absorbing daily. Be more conscious of the information that you are exposed to. What emails or facebook posts do you read?&nbsp; What are you (binge) watching on TV and the internet? Whose opinion do you seek? What do you focus on throughout your day? This isn't about being in denial or out of touch with what's going on in the world. It's about understanding how the content that we let into our minds affects our ability to focus, move forward with momentum and bring our best selves to our work and our friends and family. It's about creating an extraordinary life\! Are you more focused on negative situations around you or are you focused on information that will allow you to contribute to positive change?&nbsp; When you constantly expose yourself to upsetting and negative influences, they will start to show up in other areas of your life. Stick to the high road and focus on the positive and you will live your life from a place of power and joy\!
