I’m not sure who comes up with these holiday ideas, but this is one I think most of us can get behind. There’s a lot of division and hurtfulness out there in today’s world. A glance at the news or five minutes on social media and you’ll see a lot of example of how UNKIND people can be to one another. This week, think of the impact it would have if you and the 10 people you are closest to reached out with just one act of random kindness each day. That’s 80 acts of kindness that would touch 80 lives. And what if each one of those ten people shared the idea with ten other people? The possibilities are extraordinary. I found this wonderful article that showcases 45 acts of kindness that are sure to make you smile – and may even tug on your heartstrings a little. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.&nbsp;**[Read it here](https://t.e2ma.net/click/ic9nzc/y0qeoac/qi7oii){: target="_blank"}.**

Have a great one and please let me know if I can do ANYTHING for you\!

**DIY Tip this week Be Kind to Yourself\! Organize Your Home Office**

With many of us working out of our homes these days, If you don’t have a great place to store your office supplies, find a portable storage solution. When something has a home, you will be more likely to put it away. Here are some ideas for places to store office supplies when you don’t have a desk with a ton of drawers:&nbsp;

* [Plastic tub with a lid](https://t.e2ma.net/click/ic9nzc/y0qeoac/6a8oii){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;– be sure to use dividers or smaller containers to keep it all organized and not just one big mess.&nbsp;
* [Bookshelf](https://t.e2ma.net/click/ic9nzc/y0qeoac/m38oii){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;– dedicate one shelf to your office supplies, each in their own canisters.
* Plastic portable Drawers – or use a dresser or kitchen drawer to store your pens and office supplies\!

Organizing your office space is a little more challenging when you don’t have a dedicated office. However, this doesn’t mean you can’t have a well-organized space that can take care of all your work needs. The most important thing to remember when you organize office supplies is to keep it simple so you can stick to it for the long haul.

**Words of Wisdom&nbsp;**

Lao TzuCarry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. Princess Diana
