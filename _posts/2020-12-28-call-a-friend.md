Christmas is over and the New Year’s is upon us. But in the meantime, December 28th is National Call a Friend Day\! Between the stress of the daily grind at work, the needs of your family, and ensuring you have a little time for yourself, our lives can get awfully hectic. National Call a Friend Day reminds us all to take a few minutes, pick up the phone, and call that friend who always makes a difference. In modern times, technology has the capacity to unite us more than ever before. The internet has become the easy way to stay connected, but nothing takes the place of a human voice. In our day to day lives of whizzing from one task to the next (or even multi-tasking on all our projects at once), technology often has the opposite effect. Checking emails, answering texts, responding to Facebook notifications, and other tech-based tasks can fill up our lives and actually make us feel less connected to the people we’re spending all our time connecting with\! So, with the holiday season rapidly drawing to a close this year, reach out with a phone call today and connect, voice to voice, with a good friend or family member.
