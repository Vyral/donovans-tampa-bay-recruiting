**WORD OF THE WEEK&nbsp;[DETERMINED](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Determined&amp;cvid=831f56a0b00a4e8ab2773dfa94eb4573&amp;aqs=edge..69i57j69i64.8406j0j1&amp;pglt=675&amp;FORM=ANNTA1&amp;PC=U531)**

*&nbsp;****‚ÄúToo frequently we think we have to do spectacular things. Yet if we remember that the sea is actually made up of drops of water and each drop counts, each one of us can do our little bit where we are. Those little bits can come together and almost overwhelm the world. Each one of us can be an oasis of peace..‚Äù*&nbsp;[Desmond Tutu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_Tutu)**

**Good Morning Friends,**

**Tomorrow, Tuesday November 8th, is election day and got to thinking about the first time I voted. I recall being excited yet a little apprehensive that I might make a mistake. First, I had to find out where my polling place was, but I was bound and determined to find it. Then I was concerned that I might not know enough about a particular candidate or issue. Nonetheless, I completed my ballot and got my ‚ÄúI Voted‚Äù sticker and felt proud that I had fulfilled my duty as a citizen to exercise my right to vote\!**

**Do you recall the first time you voted? Where did you vote? &nbsp;Did you vote as soon as you turned 18 or did you take your time? Who were the candidates at the time and what was your method of voting?**

**Some people recall going into a&nbsp;[large booth with a curtain](https://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailV2&amp;ccid=B3FLhS%2fp&amp;id=AF1E3E991C3AC0FDF6560CCBD3D2E9954B8AD158&amp;thid=OIP.B3FLhS_pRNHV8bPfhOtM4wHaEs&amp;mediaurl=https%3a%2f%2fs3.amazonaws.com%2fbncore%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2017%2f11%2fLever-voting-machine-1-930x590.jpg&amp;cdnurl=https%3a%2f%2fth.bing.com%2fth%2fid%2fR.07714b852fe944d1d5f1b3df84eb4ce3%3frik%3dWNGKS5Xp0tPLDA%26pid%3dImgRaw%26r%3d0&amp;exph=590&amp;expw=930&amp;q=mechanical+lever+voting+machine+picture&amp;simid=608016637757106089&amp;FORM=IRPRST&amp;ck=9EBE955A9731AEAE174855C33F73D0F5&amp;selectedIndex=0&amp;idpp=overlayview&amp;ajaxhist=0&amp;ajaxserp=0)&nbsp;where they pulled a mechanical lever and a curtain closed around them. Standing inside, they cautiously pushed down metal levers to vote for the candidates of their choice in total privacy. (Did they worry that they might get stuck in there and they‚Äôd have to crawl out from behind the curtain to ask for help?\!)**

**Some folks may recall standing in a little plastic booth with a paper&nbsp;[punch card](https://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailV2&amp;ccid=SzJ5PLt7&amp;id=1B0B1B83E8B6765700D3BEF7C73AE6C8EB4C8AE6&amp;thid=OIP.SzJ5PLt7zgImwS1jVi2iOQHaJ4&amp;mediaurl=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.atlasobscura.com%2Fmedia%2FW1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvYXNzZXRzLzdhZjkyMTlkNTI1MjVlNjgzM19zLWwxNjAwLmpwZyJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCIiXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiLXF1YWxpdHkgODEgLWF1dG8tb3JpZW50Il0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCI2MDB4PiJdXQ%2Fs-l1600.jpg&amp;cdnurl=https%3A%2F%2Fth.bing.com%2Fth%2Fid%2FR.4b32793cbb7bce0226c12d63562da239%3Frik%3D5opM68jmOsf3vg%26pid%3DImgRaw%26r%3D0&amp;exph=800&amp;expw=600&amp;q=punch+card+voting+machines&amp;simid=608010903973741524&amp;form=IRPRST&amp;ck=276B05E9CD2F7794F55B24F9C4F65D1B&amp;selectedindex=1&amp;ajaxhist=0&amp;ajaxserp=0&amp;pivotparams=insightsToken%3Dccid_4Quc87ci*cp_96000AF18B74C716C9704BC350FA5DD1*mid_7EED0E8D529908E54CBADA246E12F94C8C12488A*simid_608021173235170292*thid_OIP.4Quc87cip7sxs9i2JpitHgHaKu&amp;vt=0&amp;sim=11&amp;iss=VSI&amp;ajaxhist=0&amp;ajaxserp=0)&nbsp;in front of them punching holes with a stylus for their candidates. (Maybe they thought about the scandal of the ‚Äúhanging chads‚Äù and if their vote would count for the right candidate?\!)**

**Still others recall filling out paper ballots and marking their candidates of choice in an oval with a ballpoint pen. The form was fed through an&nbsp;[optical scanner](https://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailV2&amp;ccid=7AzeNHBM&amp;id=1201CF674347F83A934D8E371107BA4E392B90FB&amp;thid=OIP.7AzeNHBM0gABSesUdd-NVAHaEK&amp;mediaurl=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.rappler.com%2F612F469A6EA84F6BAE882D2B94A4B421%2Fimg%2FA76DBC32F9474C5FA11B432AEAA14E59%2Fmachine_A76DBC32F9474C5FA11B432AEAA14E59.jpg&amp;cdnurl=https%3A%2F%2Fth.bing.com%2Fth%2Fid%2FR.ec0cde34704cd2000149eb1475df8d54%3Frik%3D%252b5ArOU66BxE3jg%26pid%3DImgRaw%26r%3D0&amp;exph=360&amp;expw=640&amp;q=optical+scanner+voting+image&amp;simid=608014069370588396&amp;form=IRPRST&amp;ck=32998933D74F3A5D19DA13D9EB625512&amp;selectedindex=3&amp;ajaxhist=0&amp;ajaxserp=0&amp;pivotparams=insightsToken%3Dccid_%252BV4fs9gu*cp_56EBC5719C8475F600E2599D40274D5E*mid_B48489C2020E0DB5DDCAB2CC3ACBECA6E3AE17AB*simid_608019712950088475*thid_OIP.-V4fs9guB1PhgBe1dCNVLQHaE7&amp;vt=0&amp;sim=11&amp;iss=VSI&amp;ajaxhist=0&amp;ajaxserp=0)&nbsp;to determine the count. &nbsp;(Maybe they wondered did the scanner count their vote correctly, or was there a stray mark on the page that might get counted? Or that someone could ‚Äúhijack and change their vote remotely\!)&nbsp;**

**No matter what worries or concerns we might have had about the methods used to vote, they pale in comparison to what prior generations have endured. Women only got the right to vote in 1920 after many years of&nbsp;[determination and protest](https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/womens-suffrage-movement)&nbsp;when the 19th Amendment was finally passed\! It‚Äôs even more unbelievable that minority women and men did not really get the right to vote freely until 1965 when the&nbsp;[Voting Rights Act](https://www.britannica.com/event/Voting-Rights-Act)&nbsp;was passed\!\!**

**Going outside the U.S. for a moment ‚Äì it gets even worse\! Just think, in foreign countries some people exercise their right to vote at gun-point\!**

**As I seal up my early voting ballot and take it down to my local library drop box, I realize how fortunate I am that I can vote in the privacy of my own home, choosing the candidates I feel will work in the best interest of myself and my fellow citizens. &nbsp;I know that alone, my vote might not decide an election, but remember this if you haven't already voted; your one vote is like a&nbsp;[drop of water](https://youtu.be/1KVhT2iNJVs)&nbsp;*each drop counts\!&nbsp;***
