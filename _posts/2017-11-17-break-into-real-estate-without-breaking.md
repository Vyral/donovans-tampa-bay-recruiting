Welcome back to another episode of “Keeping in Tune With the Market.”

Today’s question is: How can a new real estate agent break into the business without breaking the bank?

So, you’ve got your brand-new real estate license and you’re excited to begin. Then, things start popping up. You’re told you must subscribe to this coach or pay for that class. The issue is that all of these kinds of things cost money. But I’m here to tell you that all is not lost.

You can get great training for free. It is possible. The first thing I recommend is that you look into a program called RealtyJuggler. When you sign up at www.RealtyJuggler.com you can get a 90-day subscription for free, and it really does the job.

RealtyJuggler will help you learn how to consistently prospect, stay organized, develop a database, and have a great mindset. There are a lot of great features on the site. In the contact section, you can add all of your friends, relatives, neighbors, coworkers, and anyone else right into your database.

Once you’ve plugged in the email addresses of all of these contacts, you can begin to prospect. I’ve got a couple of resources I’d like to share that can help you do this. First, <a href="http://www.mikeferrytv.com/" target="_blank">www.MikeFerryTV.com</a> is a great, free resource for scripts, dialogue, and training.

Another place to get information is on Kevin Ward’s video blog. And, of course, we can’t forget Mr. Tom Ferry. Visit his website <a href="http://www.tomferry.com/" target="_blank">here</a> for some great tips.

We also have our own career-building video blog, which you can find here. If you would like some training on a particular topic, you can feel free to ask me a question at any time.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
