Friendships make life a whole lot better, easier, and certainly more fulfilling. Our friends can encourage us, support us, make us laugh in the midst of sadness and just listen when we've got a problem. This is a great week to honor your friends far and wide and reach out to some that perhaps you haven’t touched base with in a while to reconnect and let them know how much they matter. Whether you send a note, set aside some time for a call, message them on Facebook, or shoot them a text or message – carve out some time this week for those VIPs who have been there for you and your family through good times and bad.

**What Makes Friendships Last?**

Even though the typical friendship only lasts about 7 years per a Dutch study on the subject, a post by Kristine Felizar gives 5 reasons friendships last: Open Communication, not Judging each other, Being a good Listener, Being Consistent and Keeping in Touch. Do you want to improve a friendship you have?&nbsp;[**Read more HERE**](https://t.e2ma.net/click/j8th5b/zwff20l/by0t4d){: target="_blank"}.

**DIY Tip for the Week**

Want your house to seem more&nbsp;***friendly***? How about letting the light in your windows? We found a great post about window treatments that let in the light without giving up your privacy.&nbsp;**[Read it HERE](https://t.e2ma.net/click/j8th5b/zwff20l/rq1t4d){: target="_blank"}**

**Words of Wisdom**

*A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you.*&nbsp;Elbert Hubbard*Walking with a friend in the dark is better than walking alone in the light*. Helen Keller*There is nothing on this earth more to be prized than true friendshi*p. Thomas Aquinas*The strong bond of friendship is not always a balanced equation; friendship is not always about giving and taking in equal shares. Instead, friendship is grounded in a feeling that you know exactly who will be there for you when you need something, no matter what or when.*&nbsp;Simon Sinek*A friend is someone who gives you total freedom to be yourself.*&nbsp;Jim Morrison

Make it a Great Week & be a friend to someone who needs one\!
