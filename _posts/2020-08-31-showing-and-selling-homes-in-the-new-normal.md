Most of us know the general rules and guidelines when we're on a showing a home or on a listing presentation, but I thought a refresher and a few tips might help us all keep our guard up\!

Nearly 30% of real estate professionals say their real estate clients are still "very concerned' about the risks of Covid 19 during in person meetings and showings. With all the news and information out there demonstrating that even when cases decrease to almost zero - there is a very real danger that they could spike again if we aren't cautious and continue following the recommended guidelines. &nbsp;[**See more here about a second surge**](https://t.e2ma.net/click/xqrvxc/5wd3tzj/d3ffog){: target="_blank"}.

Here are 4 steps we can all take during these Stressful times to ensure the safety of all parties when listing or selling a home.

**\#1. Wear a mask at all times.&nbsp;**All parties, owners, buyers and realtors, should wear a mask that covers their mouth and nose. Proper wearing of the mask is not on the chin or under the nose\!&nbsp; As realtors we are mandated by the Association of Realtors to make sure this procedure is followed. If someone does not bring a mask - we should make every effort to provide one by bringing our box of masks\!

**\#2. Make sure that all visitors to a home do not unnecessarily touch&nbsp;**cabinet handles, light switches and closet doors. Also, if you do have to touch doorknobs - please wipe off knobs with sanitizing wipes. And also on this point - Please refrain from using the bathroom at the house if at all possible\!\!

**\#3. Limit the number of people that come into the house.**&nbsp;Gone are the days that whole families, including kids and grandma & grandpa came along to see the house.&nbsp; It should only be the decision makers in the purchase or limit to 2 people at a time.

**\#4. Be mindful that Homeowners, Buyers and Realtors should also try to do as much of their communication virtually**. This may mean a preliminary conversation or two on the phone or over Skype or Zoom or Facetime or it may mean viewing a virtual tour of the home online before actually meeting in person.&nbsp;

Then, If there is an interest in continuing with a listing or sale - the paperwork can also be concluded on-line with an E-Sign program\! such as Authentisign or Docusign\! (If you need a refresher - our board has some&nbsp;**[great tutorials on this subject\!](https://t.e2ma.net/click/xqrvxc/5wd3tzj/tvgfog){: target="_blank"})**

**DIY Tip for the Week**

Not that we haven't heard this all before, but cleaning and disinfecting your home, whether you are bringing groceries in from the store or a workman or visitors come over to your house, you can always pick up a few tips on posts about cleaning and disinfecting your home to prevent the danger that viruses are lurking somewhere you did not expect. Here is a great post called&nbsp;**["Disinfectants 101"](https://t.e2ma.net/click/xqrvxc/5wd3tzj/9nhfog){: target="_blank"}&nbsp; &nbsp;**(It Has a nice InfoGraphic\!)&nbsp;

**Words of Wisdom**

*“Don't ever take a fence down until you know why it was put up.” - Robert Frost*

*"Better to be safe than sorry"&nbsp; - Samuel Lover*

*"Discretion is the better part of valor. Caution is preferable to rash bravery."&nbsp; Falstaff by William Shakespeare*

*"He who fights and runs away will live to fight another day." Demosthenes*

*"When I'm stuck with a day That's grey And lonely I just stick out my chin And grin And say - Oh\!&nbsp; The sun'll come out Tomorrow&nbsp; So ya gotta hang on 'Til tomorrow&nbsp; - Come what may...&nbsp; Tomorrow, tomorrow\! I love ya tomorrow\! You're always A day Away\!" -&nbsp; Charles Strouse/Martin Charnin - Song from Annie.*

Having a plan ahead of time and putting the simple measures listed above into place will make for a safer and less stressful showing & selling of a home and perhaps, we all won't feel so "Stressed" in the New Normal\!&nbsp;

Make it a Great Week & keep yourself and others safe\!&nbsp;
