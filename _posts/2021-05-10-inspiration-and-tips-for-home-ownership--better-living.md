**We've had it up to our ears in tough news, challenges, and a roller coaster of emotion for a long while now. It's interesting though. With the flip of a station, and a mental shift, you can choose to focus on good news over bad. That starts by filtering what you let in. From social media, to television, to radio, even to people. Our joy goes up in direct proportion to when toxicity and negativity go down.&nbsp;**

**Lately, I've really been focused on finding the good news. Happy thoughts. Things that make me laugh and smile and that contribute to the well being of not just me, but our world. Think about how you can change the channel in your days so that you're filtering in the good stuff and not letting the negative slip into your life and your business. It's a game-changer, I promise\!
