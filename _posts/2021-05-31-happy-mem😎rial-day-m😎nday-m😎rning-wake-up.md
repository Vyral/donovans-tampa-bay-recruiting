**Sometimes it is so tempting to choose something other than what we really want in our work, relationships or even our surroundings. But why settle? Did you ever stop to think about the fact that your 24-hour day is somewhat divided into thirds? &nbsp;1/3 of your day is spent sleeping, 1/3 is spent working, and 1/3 is spent with those who you have a relationship with. Which also means that 1/3 of your life falls into one of those categories. When you think of it that way, it becomes really important to choose carefully.**

**The good news is that a lot comes down to three simple, but incredibly important decisions:**

**1\. Choose a great mattress, because 1/3 of your day is spent there. \*See Real Estate Tip below for finding a good mattress\!**

**2\. Choose a job or profession you care about, for it will be with you for 1/3 of your entire life. Check out 3 Simple Steps to Finding a Job You Love&nbsp;[CLICK HERE](https://t.e2ma.net/click/w637ne/sbltq1c/kdtmln){: target="_blank"}**

**Life is short but it feels longer when you spend it with the wrong people, on the wrong mattress or doing the wrong thing with your life\!&nbsp; When you think about the fact that your life is divided into thirds, it is not nearly as overwhelming as trying to get everything about every day right. Make good choices in these three areas of your life and you are more likely to be happy, fulfilled AND well-rested\!&nbsp;**
