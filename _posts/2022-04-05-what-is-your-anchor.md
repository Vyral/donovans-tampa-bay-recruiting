**&nbsp;*****“What an anchor is to a ship, hope is to the soul. Both ships and souls are kept safe by a firm, secure anchor that keeps holding despite turbulent winds and churning tides" - Jane Hunt***

**What do you do when you are facing a“storm” in life? When there are high winds and there is a storm approaching and you are a sailor, you know that you must drop anchor.**

**In&nbsp;[The Happiness Trap](https://t.e2ma.net/click/3zwptd/jw4ppix/nfy48e){: target="_blank"}, by Russ Harris, we are learning how to “[Drop Anchor](https://t.e2ma.net/click/3zwptd/jw4ppix/37y48e){: target="_blank"}” to help get us through the storms of life. &nbsp;Here are three tips we can learn from our sea-faring friends which can be applied as we face the storms of life.\***

**\*Disclaimer:&nbsp; I am the least likely person to explore techniques used when sailing because I get&nbsp;[severe motion sickness&nbsp;](https://t.e2ma.net/click/3zwptd/jw4ppix/j0z48e){: target="_blank"}and no one in their right mind would ever want to have me on their boat\! &nbsp;**

**None-the-less, here is a little research I did on what good sailors do to prepare for a storm and 3 techniques which we can use:&nbsp; 1. Clear the decks, 2. Drop anchor near level ground and 3. Be rigged and ready. Let me explain:**

**The first thing a good sailor does when a storm is approaching, is to clear the decks. &nbsp;In life, clearing the decks means making sure extraneous “stuff” is safely stowed away so it won’t be tossed about during the storm, thus distracting us from the task at hand. &nbsp;We, too, want to be able to devote full attention to preparation for the storms that pop up in our lives. Especially the tremendous stress of the last several years plus the normal problems, accidents and sadness that sooner or later come to each one of us. We need to be able to focus but we often find that having a number of things come at us at once is often the least effective way to do that.**

**Second, the expert sailor does not anchor close to the rocks, but rather,&nbsp;[drops anchor near level ground](https://t.e2ma.net/click/3zwptd/jw4ppix/zs048e){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;facing the shore. In this way he doesn’t get thrown into the rocks if the wind is too strong but instead is anchored in a calm, safe environment. We too, want to surround ourselves with level headed people who serve as a good example for how to deal with the storms of life and can provide us with advice and counsel in the midst of a storm.**

**Third, in a storm, smart sailors keep their boat rigged and ready to go. In other words, if something were to happen to their anchor, they are prepared and ready to take the wheel at a moment’s notice and move their boat out of harm’s way. We too, need to think ahead so that if Plan A is not working and we run into high winds or unexpected obstacles, we always have a Plan B we can fall back on.&nbsp; When you encounter the storms of life, just stop, think and be grateful that you will get another chance to learn through your trials. As&nbsp;[Franklin D. Roosevelt](https://t.e2ma.net/click/3zwptd/jw4ppix/fl148e){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;once said: "A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor"&nbsp;**

**REAL ESTATE CORNER: &nbsp;Speaking of "Anchors" Hurricane season will come around sooner than we think. Does your roof need a Hurricane Strap Retrofit to secure it in case of really high winds?
